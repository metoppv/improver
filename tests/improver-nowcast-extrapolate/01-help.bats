                                    INPUT_FILEPATH

Extrapolate input data to required lead times.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILEPATH        Path to input NetCDF file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory to write output files.
  --output_filepaths OUTPUT_FILEPATHS [OUTPUT_FILEPATHS ...]
                        List of full paths to output nowcast files, in order
                        of increasing lead time.
  --orographic_enhancement_filepaths OROGRAPHIC_ENHANCEMENT_FILEPATHS [OROGRAPHIC_ENHANCEMENT_FILEPATHS ...]
                        List or wildcarded file specification to the input
                        orographic enhancement files. Orographic enhancement
                        files are compulsory for precipitation fields.
  --json_file JSON_FILE
                        Filename for the json file containing required changes
                        to the attributes. Defaults to None.
  --max_lead_time MAX_LEAD_TIME
                        Maximum lead time required (mins).
  --lead_time_interval LEAD_TIME_INTERVAL
                        Interval between required lead times (mins).

Advect using files containing the x  and y components of the velocity:
  --eastward_advection_filepath EASTWARD_ADVECTION_FILEPATH
                        Path to input file containing Eastward advection
                        velocities.
  --northward_advection_filepath NORTHWARD_ADVECTION_FILEPATH
                        Path to input file containing Northward advection
                        velocities.

Advect using files containing speed and direction:
  --advection_speed_filepath ADVECTION_SPEED_FILEPATH
                        Path to input file containing advection speeds,
                        usually wind speeds, on multiple pressure levels.
  --advection_direction_filepath ADVECTION_DIRECTION_FILEPATH
                        Path to input file containing the directions from
                        which advection speeds are coming (180 degrees from
                        the direction in which the speed is directed). The
                        directions should be on the same grid as the input
                        speeds, including the same vertical levels.
  --pressure_level PRESSURE_LEVEL
                        The pressure level in Pa to extract from the multi-
                        level advection_speed and advection_direction files.
                        The velocities at this level are used for advection.

Calculate accumulations from advected fields:
  --accumulation_fidelity ACCUMULATION_FIDELITY
                        If set, this CLI will additionally return
                        accumulations calculated from the advected fields.
                        This fidelity specifies the time interval in minutes
                        between advected fields that is used to calculate
                        these accumulations. This interval must be a factor of
                        the lead_time_interval.
  --accumulation_period ACCUMULATION_PERIOD
                        The period over which the accumulation is calculated
                        (mins). Only full accumulation periods will be
                        computed. At lead times that are shorter than the
                        accumulation period, no accumulation output will be
                        produced.
  --accumulation_units ACCUMULATION_UNITS
                        Desired units in which the accumulations should be
                        expressed,e.g. mm
__TEXT__
  [[ "$output" =~ "$expected" ]]
