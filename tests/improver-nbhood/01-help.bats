                       OUTPUT_FILE

Apply the requested neighbourhood method via the NeighbourhoodProcessing
plugin to a file with one cube.

positional arguments:
  NEIGHBOURHOOD_METHOD  The neighbourhood method to apply in neighbourhood
                        processing. Options: "probabilities", "percentiles".
  NEIGHBOURHOOD_SHAPE   The neighbourhood shape to apply in neighbourhood
                        processing. Options: "circular", "square".
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --radius RADIUS       The radius (in m) for neighbourhood processing.
  --radii-by-lead-time RADII_BY_LEAD_TIME LEAD_TIME_IN_HOURS
                        The radii for neighbourhood processing and the
                        associated lead times at which the radii are valid.
                        The radii are in metres whilst the lead time has units
                        of hours. The radii and lead times are expected as
                        individual comma-separated lists with the list of
                        radii given first followed by a list of lead times to
                        indicate at what lead time each radii should be used.
                        For example: 10000,12000,14000 1,2,3 where a lead time
                        of 1 hour uses a radius of 10000m, a lead time of 2
                        hours uses a radius of 12000m, etc.
  --ens_factor ENS_FACTOR
                        The factor with which to adjust the neighbourhood size
                        for more than one ensemble member. If ens_factor = 1.0
                        this essentially conserves ensemble members if every
                        grid square is considered to be the equivalent of an
                        ensemble member.Optional, defaults to 1.0.
