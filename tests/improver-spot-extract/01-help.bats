                             [LAPSE_RATE_FILEPATH] OUTPUT_FILEPATH

Extract diagnostic data from gridded fields for spot data sites. It is
possible to apply a temperature lapse rate adjustment to temperature data that
helps to account for differences between the spot sites real altitude and that
of the grid point from which the temperature data is extracted.

positional arguments:
  NEIGHBOUR_FILEPATH    Path to a NetCDF file of spot-data neighbours. This
                        file also contains the spot site information.
  DIAGNOSTIC_FILEPATH   Path to a NetCDF file containing the diagnostic data
                        to be extracted.
  LAPSE_RATE_FILEPATH   (Optional) Filepath to a NetCDF file containing
                        temperature lapse rates. If this cube is provided, and
                        a screen temperature cube is being processed, the
                        lapse rates will be used to adjust the temperatures to
                        better represent each spot's site-altitude.
  OUTPUT_FILEPATH       The output path for the resulting NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --new_title NEW_TITLE
                        Title attribute for spot-extracted data. If not set,
                        this attribute is removed, since it has no prescribed
                        standard and may therefore contain grid information
                        that is no longer correct after spot-extraction.
  --apply_lapse_rate_correction
                        If the option is set and a lapse rate cube has been
                        provided, extracted screen temperatures will be
                        adjusted to better match the altitude of the spot site
                        for which they have been extracted.
  --ecc_bounds_warning  If True, where calculated percentiles are outside the
                        ECC bounds range, raise a warning rather than an
                        exception.

Neighbour finding method:
  If none of these options are set, the nearest grid point to a spot site
  will be used without any other constraints.

  --land_constraint     If set the neighbour cube will be interrogated for
                        grid point neighbours that were identified using a
                        land constraint. This means that the grid points
                        should be land points except for sites where none were
                        found within the search radius when the neighbour cube
                        was created. May be used with minimum_dz.
  --minimum_dz          If set the neighbour cube will be interrogated for
                        grid point neighbours that were identified using a
                        minimum height difference constraint. These are grid
                        points that were found to be the closest in altitude
                        to the spot site within the search radius defined when
                        the neighbour cube was created. May be used with
                        land_constraint.

Extract percentiles:
  Extract particular percentiles from probabilistic, percentile, or
  realization inputs. If deterministic input is provided a warning is raised
  and all leading dimensions are included in the returned spot-data cube.

  --extract_percentiles EXTRACT_PERCENTILES [EXTRACT_PERCENTILES ...]
                        If set to a percentile value or a list of percentile
                        values, data corresponding to those percentiles will
                        be returned. For example setting '--
                        extract_percentiles 25 50 75' will result in the 25th,
                        50th, and 75th percentiles being returned from a cube
                        of probabilities, percentiles, or realizations. Note
                        that for percentile inputs, the desired percentile(s)
                        must exist in the input cube.

Suppress Verbose output:
  --suppress_warnings   Suppress warning output. This option should only be
                        used if it is known that warnings will be generated
                        but they are not required.
