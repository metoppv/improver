SpotData : A configurable tool to extract spot-data from gridded diagnostics.
The method of interpolating and adjusting the resulting data can be set by
defining suitable diagnostics configurations.

positional arguments:
  config_file_path      Path to a json file defining the recipes for
                        extracting diagnostics at SpotData sites from gridded
                        data.
  data_path             Path to a file containing the diagnostic to be
                        processed.
  ancillary_path        Path to ancillary (time invariant) data files.
  output_path           Path to which output files should be written.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --diagnostics DIAGNOSTICS [DIAGNOSTICS ...]
                        A list of diagnostics that are to be processed. If
                        unset, all diagnostics defined in the config_file will
                        be produced; e.g. temperature wind_speed
  --site_path SITE_PATH
                        Path to site data file if this is being used to choose
                        sites.
  --constants_path CONSTANTS_PATH
                        Path to json file containing constants to use in
                        SpotData methods.
  --latitudes (-90,90) [(-90,90) ...]
                        List of latitudes of sites of interest.
  --longitudes (-180,180) [(-180,180) ...]
                        List of longitudes of sites of interest.
  --altitudes ALTITUDES [ALTITUDES ...]
                        List of altitudes of sites of interest.
  --multiprocess        Process diagnostics using multiprocessing.
