Calculate orographic enhancement using the ResolveWindComponents() and
OrographicEnhancement() plugins. Outputs data on the high resolution orography
grid.

positional arguments:
  TEMPERATURE_FILEPATH  Full path to input NetCDF file of temperature on
                        height levels
  HUMIDITY_FILEPATH     Full path to input NetCDF file of relative humidity on
                        height levels
  PRESSURE_FILEPATH     Full path to input NetCDF file of pressure on height
                        levels
  WINDSPEED_FILEPATH    Full path to input NetCDF file of wind speed on height
                        levels
  WINDDIR_FILEPATH      Full path to input NetCDF file of wind direction on
                        height levels
  OROGRAPHY_FILEPATH    Full path to input NetCDF high resolution orography
                        ancillary. This should be on the same or a finer
                        resolution grid than the input variables, and defines
                        the grid on which the orographic enhancement will be
                        calculated.
  OUTPUT_DIR            Directory to write output orographic enhancement files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --boundary_height BOUNDARY_HEIGHT
                        Model height level to extract variables for
                        calculating orographic enhancement, as proxy for the
                        boundary layer.
  --boundary_height_units BOUNDARY_HEIGHT_UNITS
                        Units of the boundary height specified for extracting
                        model levels.
