Apply Ensemble Copula Coupling to a file whose data can be loaded as a single
iris.cube.Cube.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --no_of_percentiles NUMBER_OF_PERCENTILES
                        The number of percentiles to be generated. This is
                        also equal to the number of ensemble members that will
                        be generated.
  --sampling_method [PERCENTILE_SAMPLING_METHOD]
                        Method to be used for generating the list of
                        percentiles with forecasts generated at each
                        percentile. The options are "quantile" and "random".
                        "quantile" is the default option.
  --reordering          The option used to create ensemble members from
                        percentiles by reordering the input percentiles based
                        on the order of the raw ensemble forecast.
  --rebadging           The option used to create ensemble members from
                        percentiles by rebadging the input percentiles.

Reordering options:
  Options for reordering the input percentiles using the raw ensemble
  forecast as required to create ensemble members.

  --raw_forecast_filepath RAW_FORECAST_FILE
                        A path to an raw forecast NetCDF file to be processed.
                        This option is compulsory, if the reordering option is
                        selected.
  --random_ordering     Decide whether or not to use random ordering within
                        the ensemble reordering step.
  --random_seed RANDOM_SEED
                        Option to specify a value for the random seed for
                        testing purposes, otherwise, the default random seed
                        behaviour is utilised. The random seed is used in the
                        generation of the random numbers used for either the
                        random_ordering option to order the input percentiles
                        randomly, rather than use the ordering from the raw
                        ensemble, or for splitting tied values within the raw
                        ensemble, so that the values from the input
                        percentiles can be ordered to match the raw ensemble.

Rebadging options:
  Options for rebadging the input percentiles as ensemble members.

  --member_numbers MEMBER_NUMBERS
                        A list of ensemble member numbers to use when
                        rebadging the percentiles into members.
