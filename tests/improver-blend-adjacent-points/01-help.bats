Use the TriangularWeightedBlendAcrossAdjacentPoints to blend across a
particular coordinate. It does not collapse the coordinate, but instead blends
across adjacent points and puts the blending values back in the original
coordinate. Two different types of blending are possible, weighted_mean and
weighted_maximum

positional arguments:
  COORDINATE_TO_BLEND_OVER
                        The coordinate over which the blending will be
                        applied.
  WEIGHTED_BLEND_MODE   The method used in the weighted blend.
                        "weighted_mean": calculate a normal weighted mean
                        across the coordinate. "weighted_maximum": multiplies
                        the values in the coordinate by the weights, and then
                        takes the maximum.
  TRIANGLE_WIDTH        Width of the triangular weighting function used in the
                        blending, in the units of the parameter_unit passed
                        in.
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --parameter_unit UNIT_STRING
                        Units for time coordinate. Default= hours since
                        1970-01-01 00:00:00.
  --calendar CALENDAR   Calendar for parameter_unit if required.
                        Default=gregorian
