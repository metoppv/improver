Use the TriangularWeightedBlendAcrossAdjacentPoints to blend across a
particular coordinate. It does not collapse the coordinate, but instead blends
across adjacent points and puts the blended values back in the original
coordinate, with adjusted bounds.

positional arguments:
  COORDINATE_TO_BLEND_OVER
                        The coordinate over which the blending will be
                        applied.
  CENTRAL_POINT         Central point at which the output from the triangular
                        weighted blending will be calculated. This should be
                        in the units of the units argument that is passed in.
                        This value should be a point on the coordinate for
                        blending over.
  WEIGHTED_BLEND_MODE   The method used in the weighted blend.
                        "weighted_mean": calculate a normal weighted mean
                        across the coordinate.
  INPUT_FILES           Paths to input NetCDF files including and surrounding
                        the central_point.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --units UNIT_STRING   Units of the the central_point and width.
  --calendar CALENDAR   Calendar for parameter_unit if required.
                        Default=gregorian
  --width TRIANGLE_WIDTH
                        Width of the triangular weighting function used in the
                        blending, in the units of the units argument passed
                        in.
  --blend_time_using_forecast_period
                        Flag that we are blending over time but using the
                        forecast period coordinate as a proxy. Note this
                        should only be used when time and forecast_period
                        share a dimension: ie when all files provided are from
                        the same forecast cycle.
