Estimate coefficients for Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS), otherwise
known as Non-homogeneous Gaussian Regression (NGR)

positional arguments:
  DISTRIBUTION          The distribution that will be used for calibration.
                        This will be dependent upon the input phenomenon. This
                        has to be supported by the minimisation functions in
                        ContinuousRankedProbabilityScoreMinimisers.
  CYCLETIME             This denotes the cycle at which forecasts will be
                        calibrated using the calculated EMOS coefficients. The
                        validity time in the output coefficients cube will be
                        calculated relative to this cycletime. This cycletime
                        is in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ.
  HISTORIC_FILEPATH     A path to an input NetCDF file containing the historic
                        forecast(s) used for calibration.
  TRUTH_FILEPATH        A path to an input NetCDF file containing the historic
                        truth analyses used for calibration.
  OUTPUT_FILEPATH       The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --units UNITS         The units that calibration should be undertaken in.
                        The historical forecast and truth will be converted as
                        required.
  --predictor_of_mean PREDICTOR_OF_MEAN
                        String to specify the predictor used to calibrate the
                        forecast mean. Currently the ensemble mean ("mean")
                        and the ensemble realizations ("realizations") are
                        supported as options. Default: "mean".
  --max_iterations MAX_ITERATIONS
                        The maximum number of iterations allowed until the
                        minimisation has converged to a stable solution. If
                        the maximum number of iterations is reached, but the
                        minimisation has not yet converged to a stable
                        solution, then the available solution is used anyway,
                        and a warning is raised.This may be modified for
                        testing purposes but otherwise kept fixed. If the
                        predictor_of_mean is "realizations", then the number
                        of iterations may require increasing, as there will be
                        more coefficients to solve for.
