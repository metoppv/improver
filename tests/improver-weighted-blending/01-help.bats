                                  [INPUT_FILES ...] OUTPUT_FILE

Calculate the default weights to apply in weighted blending plugins using the
ChooseDefaultWeightsLinear or ChooseDefaultWeightsNonLinear plugins. Then
apply these weights to the dataset using the BasicWeightedAverage plugin.
Required for ChooseDefaultWeightsLinear: y0val and ynval. Required for
ChooseDefaultWeightsNonLinear: cval. Required for ChooseWeightsLinear with
dict: wts_dict.

positional arguments:
  COORDINATE_TO_AVERAGE_OVER
                        The coordinate over which the blending will be
                        applied.
  WEIGHTED_BLEND_MODE   The method used in the weighted blend.
                        "weighted_mean": calculate a normal weighted mean
                        across the coordinate. "weighted_maximum": multiplies
                        the values in the coordinate by the weights, and then
                        takes the maximum.
  INPUT_FILES           Paths to input files to be blended.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --wts_calc_method WEIGHTS_CALCULATION_METHOD
                        Method to use to calculate weights used in blending.
                        "linear" (default): calculate linearly varying
                        blending weights. "nonlinear": calculate blending
                        weights that decrease exponentially with increasing
                        blending coordinate. "dict": calculate weights using a
                        dictionary passed in as a command line argument.
  --coordinate_unit UNIT_STRING
                        Units for blending coordinate. Default= hours since
                        1970-01-01 00:00:00
  --calendar CALENDAR   Calendar for time coordinate. Default=gregorian
  --cycletime CYCLETIME
                        The forecast reference time to be used after blending
                        has been applied, in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ. If not
                        provided, the blended file will take the latest
                        available forecast reference time from the input cubes
                        supplied.

linear weights options:
  Options for the linear weights calculation in ChooseDefaultWeightsLinear

  --y0val LINEAR_STARTING_POINT
                        The relative value of the weighting start point
                        (lowest value of blend coord) for choosing default
                        linear weights. This must be a positive float or 0.
  --ynval LINEAR_END_POINT
                        The relative value of the weighting end point (highest
                        value of blend coord) for choosing default linear
                        weights. This must be a positive float or 0. Note that
                        if blending over forecast reference time, ynval >=
                        y0val would normally be expected (to give greater
                        weight to the more recent forecast).

nonlinear weights options:
  Options for the non-linear weights calculation in
  ChooseDefaultWeightsNonLinear

  --cval NON_LINEAR_FACTOR
                        Factor used to determine how skewed the non linear
                        weights will be. A value of 1 implies equal weighting.
                        If not set, a default value of cval=0.85 is set.

dict weights options:
  Options for linear weights to be calculated based on parameters read from
  a json file dict

  --wts_dict WEIGHTS_DICTIONARY
                        Path to json file containing dictionary from which to
                        calculate blending weights. Dictionary format is as
                        specified in the
                        improver.blending.weights.ChooseWeightsLinear plugin.
  --weighting_coord WEIGHTING_COORD
                        Name of coordinate over which linear weights should be
                        scaled. This coordinate must be avilable in the
                        weights dictionary.
  --wts_mask_constraint WEIGHTS_MASK_CONSTRAINT
                        Optional constraint by which to identify an input cube
                        whose mask should be used to calculate spatially
                        varying blending weights. These are then scaled along
                        the weighting coordinate using the dictionary derived
                        weights.
