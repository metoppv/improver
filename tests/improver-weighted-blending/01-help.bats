Calculate the default weights to apply in weighted blending plugins using the
ChooseDefaultWeightsLinear or ChooseDefaultWeightsNonLinear plugins. Then
apply these weights to the dataset using the BasicWeightedAverage plugin.
Required for ChooseDefaultWeightsLinear: y0val and ynval. Required for
ChooseDefaultWeightsNonLinear: cval. Required for ChooseWeightsLinear with
dict: wts_dict.

positional arguments:
  COORDINATE_TO_AVERAGE_OVER
                        The coordinate over which the blending will be
                        applied.
  INPUT_FILES           Paths to input files to be blended.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --wts_calc_method WEIGHTS_CALCULATION_METHOD
                        Method to use to calculate weights used in blending.
                        "linear" (default): calculate linearly varying
                        blending weights. "nonlinear": calculate blending
                        weights that decrease exponentially with increasing
                        blending coordinate. "dict": calculate weights using a
                        dictionary passed in as a command line argument.
  --cycletime CYCLETIME
                        The forecast reference time to be used after blending
                        has been applied, in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ. If not
                        provided, the blended file will take the latest
                        available forecast reference time from the input cubes
                        supplied.
  --model_id_attr MODEL_ID_ATTR
                        The name of the netCDF file attribute to be used to
                        identify the source model for multi-model blends.
                        Default is None. Must be present on all input files if
                        blending over models.
  --spatial_weights_from_mask
                        If set this option will result in the generation of
                        spatially varying weights based on the masks of the
                        data we are blending. The one dimensional weights are
                        first calculated using the chosen weights calculation
                        method, but the weights will then be adjusted
                        spatially based on where there is masked data in the
                        data we are blending. The spatial weights are
                        calculated using the SpatiallyVaryingWeightsFromMask
                        plugin.

Spatial weights from mask options:
  Options for calculating the spatial weights using the
  SpatiallyVaryingWeightsFromMask plugin.

  --fuzzy_length FUZZY_LENGTH
                        When calculating spatially varying weights we can
                        smooth the weights so that areas close to areas that
                        are masked have lower weights than those further away.
                        This fuzzy length controls the scale over which the
                        weights are smoothed. The fuzzy length is in terms of
                        m, the default is 20km. This distance is then
                        converted into a number of grid squares, which does
                        not have to be an integer. Assumes the grid spacing is
                        the same in the x and y directions, and raises an
                        error if this is not true. See
                        SpatiallyVaryingWeightsFromMask for more detail.

linear weights options:
  Options for the linear weights calculation in ChooseDefaultWeightsLinear

  --y0val LINEAR_STARTING_POINT
                        The relative value of the weighting start point
                        (lowest value of blend coord) for choosing default
                        linear weights. This must be a positive float or 0.
  --ynval LINEAR_END_POINT
                        The relative value of the weighting end point (highest
                        value of blend coord) for choosing default linear
                        weights. This must be a positive float or 0. Note that
                        if blending over forecast reference time, ynval >=
                        y0val would normally be expected (to give greater
                        weight to the more recent forecast).

nonlinear weights options:
  Options for the non-linear weights calculation in
  ChooseDefaultWeightsNonLinear

  --cval NON_LINEAR_FACTOR
                        Factor used to determine how skewed the non linear
                        weights will be. A value of 1 implies equal weighting.
                        If not set, a default value of cval=0.85 is set.

dict weights options:
  Options for linear weights to be calculated based on parameters read from
  a json file dict

  --wts_dict WEIGHTS_DICTIONARY
                        Path to json file containing dictionary from which to
                        calculate blending weights. Dictionary format is as
                        specified in the
                        improver.blending.weights.ChooseWeightsLinear plugin.
  --weighting_coord WEIGHTING_COORD
                        Name of coordinate over which linear weights should be
                        scaled. This coordinate must be available in the
                        weights dictionary.
