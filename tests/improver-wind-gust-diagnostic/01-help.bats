Calculate revised wind-gust data using a specified percentile of wind-gust
data and a specified percentile of wind-speed data through the
WindGustDiagnostic plugin. The wind-gust diagnostic will be the Max of the
specified percentile data.Currently Typical gusts is MAX(wind-gust(50th
percentile),wind-speed(95th percentile))and Extreme gust is MAX(wind-gust(95th
percentile),wind-speed(100th percentile)). If no percentile values are
supplied the code defaults to values for Typical gusts.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE_GUST       A path to an input Wind Gust Percentile NetCDF file
  INPUT_FILE_WINDSPEED  A path to an input Wind Speed Percentile NetCDF file
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --percentile_gust PERCENTILE_GUST
                        Percentile of wind-gust required. Default=50.0
  --percentile_ws PERCENTILE_WIND_SPEED
                        Percentile of wind-speed required. Default=95.0
