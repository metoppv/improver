                       SOURCE_DATA TARGET_GRID OUTPUT_FILE

Regrid data from source_data on to the grid contained within target_grid using
iris.analysis.Linear() or optionally iris.analysis.Nearest()

positional arguments:
  SOURCE_DATA           A cube of data that is to be regridded onto the
                        target_grid.
  TARGET_GRID           A cube containing the grid to which the source_data is
                        to be regridded.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --nearest             If True, regridding will be performed using
                        iris.analysis.Nearest() instead of Linear(). Use for
                        less continuous fields, e.g. precipitation.
  --extrapolation_mode EXTRAPOLATION_MODE
                        Mode to use for extrapolating data into regions beyond
                        the limits of the source_data domain. Modes are:
                        extrapolate - The extrapolation points will take their
                        value from the nearest source point. nan - The
                        extrapolation points will be be set to NaN. error - A
                        ValueError exception will be raised, notifying an
                        attempt to extrapolate. mask - The extrapolation
                        points will always be masked, even if the source data
                        is not a MaskedArray. nanmask - If the source data is
                        a MaskedArray the extrapolation points will be masked.
                        Otherwise they will be set to NaN. Defaults to
                        nanmask.
