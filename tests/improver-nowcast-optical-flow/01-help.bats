                                     INPUT_FILEPATHS

Calculate optical flow components from input fields and (optionally)
extrapolate to required lead times.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILEPATHS       Paths to the input radar files. There should be 3
                        input files at T, T-1 and T-2 from which to calculate
                        optical flow velocities. The files require a 'time'
                        coordinate on which they are sorted, so the order of
                        inputs does not matter.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory to write all output files, or only advection
                        velocity components if NOWCAST_FILEPATHS is specified.
  --nowcast_filepaths NOWCAST_FILEPATHS [NOWCAST_FILEPATHS ...]
                        Optional list of full paths to output nowcast files.
                        Overrides OUTPUT_DIR. Ignored unless '--extrapolate'
                        is set.
  --orographic_enhancement_filepaths OROGRAPHIC_ENHANCEMENT_FILEPATHS [OROGRAPHIC_ENHANCEMENT_FILEPATHS ...]
                        List or wildcarded file specification to the input
                        orographic enhancement files. Orographic enhancement
                        files are compulsory for precipitation fields.
  --json_file JSON_FILE
                        Filename for the json file containing required changes
                        to attributes. Every output file will have the
                        attributes_dict applied. Defaults to None.
  --ofc_box_size OFC_BOX_SIZE
                        Size of square 'box' (in grid squares) within which to
                        solve the optical flow equations.
  --smart_smoothing_iterations SMART_SMOOTHING_ITERATIONS
                        Number of iterations to perform in enforcing
                        smoothness constraint for optical flow velocities.
  --extrapolate         Optional flag to advect current data forward to
                        specified lead times.
  --max_lead_time MAX_LEAD_TIME
                        Maximum lead time required (mins). Ignored unless '--
                        extrapolate' is set.
  --lead_time_interval LEAD_TIME_INTERVAL
                        Interval between required lead times (mins). Ignored
                        unless '--extrapolate' is set.
