                                        OUTPUT_FILEPATH

Apply coefficients for Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS), otherwise
known as Non-homogeneous Gaussian Regression (NGR). The supported input
formats are realizations, probabilities and percentiles. The forecast will be
converted to realizations before applying the coefficients and then converted
back to match the input format.

positional arguments:
  FORECAST_FILEPATH     A path to an input NetCDF file containing the forecast
                        to be calibrated. The input format could be either
                        realizations, probabilities or percentiles.
  COEFFICIENTS_FILEPATH
                        (Optional) A path to an input NetCDF file containing
                        the coefficients used for calibration. If this file is
                        not provided the input forecast is returned unchanged.
  OUTPUT_FILEPATH       The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --num_realizations NUMBER_OF_REALIZATIONS
                        Optional argument to specify the number of ensemble
                        realizations to produce. If the current forecast is
                        input as probabilities or percentiles then this
                        argument is used to create the requested number of
                        realizations. In addition, this argument is used to
                        construct the requested number of realizations from
                        the mean and variance output after applying the EMOS
                        coefficients.Default will be the number of
                        realizations in the raw input file, if realizations
                        are provided as input, otherwise if the input format
                        is probabilities or percentiles, then an error will be
                        raised if no value is provided.
  --random_ordering     Option to reorder the post-processed forecasts
                        randomly. If not set, the ordering of the raw ensemble
                        is used. This option is only valid when the input
                        format is realizations.
  --random_seed RANDOM_SEED
                        Option to specify a value for the random seed for
                        testing purposes, otherwise, the default random seed
                        behaviour is utilised. The random seed is used in the
                        generation of the random numbers used for either the
                        random_ordering option to order the input percentiles
                        randomly, rather than use the ordering from the raw
                        ensemble, or for splitting tied values within the raw
                        ensemble, so that the values from the input
                        percentiles can be ordered to match the raw ensemble.
  --ecc_bounds_warning  If True, where the percentiles exceed the ECC bounds
                        range, raise a warning rather than an exception. This
                        occurs when the current forecast is in the form of
                        probabilities and is converted to percentiles, as part
                        of converting the input probabilities into
                        realizations.
  --predictor_of_mean PREDICTOR_OF_MEAN
                        String to specify the predictor used to calibrate the
                        forecast mean. Currently the ensemble mean ("mean")
                        and the ensemble realizations ("realizations") are
                        supported as options. Default: "mean".
  --landsea_mask LANDSEA_MASK
                        The netCDF file containing a land-sea mask on the same
                        domain as the forecast that is to be calibrated. Land
                        points are specified by ones and sea points are
                        specified by zeros. Supplying this file will enable
                        land-only calibration, in which sea points are
                        returned without the application of calibration.
