Run a recursive filter to convert a square neighbourhood into a Gaussian-like
kernel or smooth over short distances. The filter uses an alpha parameter
(0>=alpha<1) to control what proportion of the probability is passed onto the
next grid-square in the x and y directions. The alpha parameter can be set on
a grid-square by grid-square basis (using an array of alpha parameters of the
same dimensionality as the domain). Alternatively a single alpha value can be
set for each of the x and y directions.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input_filepath_alphas_x ALPHAS_X
                        A path to a NetCDF file describing the alpha factors
                        to be used for smoothing in the x direction
  --input_filepath_alphas_y ALPHAS_Y
                        A path to a NetCDF file describing the alpha factors
                        to be used for smoothing in the y direction
  --alpha_x ALPHA_X     A single alpha factor (0>=alpha_x<1) to be applied to
                        every grid square in the x direction.
  --alpha_y ALPHA_Y     A single alpha factor (0>=alpha_y<1) to be applied to
                        every grid square in the y direction.
  --iterations ITERATIONS
                        Number of cycles over which to apply the filter
  --input_mask_filepath INPUT_MASK_FILE
                        A path to an input mask NetCDF file to be used to mask
                        the input file.
  --re_mask             Re-apply mask to recursively filtered output.
