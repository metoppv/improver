                                         INPUT_MASK_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

Apply the requested neighbourhood method via the
ApplyNeighbourhoodProcessingWithAMask plugin to a file with one diagnostic
dataset in combination with a file containing one or more masks. The mask
dataset may have an extra dimension compared to the input diagnostic. In this
case, the user specifies the name of the extra coordinate and this coordinate
is iterated over so each mask is applied to seperate slices over the input
data. These intermediate masked datasets are then concatenated, resulting in a
dataset that has been processed using multiple masks and has gained an extra
dimension from the masking. There is also an option to re-mask the output
dataset, so that after neighbourhood processing, non-zero values are only
present for unmasked grid points. There is an alternative option of collapsing
the dimension that we gain using this processing using a weighted average.

positional arguments:
  COORD_FOR_MASKING     Coordinate to iterate over when applying a mask to the
                        neighbourhood processing.
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed.
  INPUT_MASK_FILE       A path to an input mask NetCDF file to be used to mask
                        the input file.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --radius RADIUS       The radius (in m) for neighbourhood processing.
  --radii-by-lead-time RADII_BY_LEAD_TIME LEAD_TIME_IN_HOURS
                        The radii for neighbourhood processing and the
                        associated lead times at which the radii are valid.
                        The radii are in metres whilst the lead time has units
                        of hours. The radii and lead times are expected as
                        individual comma-separated lists with the list of
                        radii given first followed by a list of lead times to
                        indicate at what lead time each radii should be used.
                        For example: 10000,12000,14000 1,2,3 where a lead time
                        of 1 hour uses a radius of 10000m, a lead time of 2
                        hours uses a radius of 12000m, etc.
  --sum_or_fraction {sum,fraction}
                        The neighbourhood output can either be in the form of
                        a sum of the neighbourhood, or a fraction calculated
                        by dividing the sum of the neighbourhood by the
                        neighbourhood area. "fraction" is the default option.
  --re_mask             If re_mask is set (i.e. True), the output data
                        following neighbourhood processing is re-masked. This
                        re-masking removes any values that have been generated
                        by neighbourhood processing at grid points that were
                        originally masked. If not set, re_mask defaults to
                        False and no re-masking is applied to the
                        neighbourhood processed output. Therefore, the
                        neighbourhood processing may result in values being
                        present in areas that were originally masked. This
                        allows the the values in adjacent bands to beweighted
                        together if the additional dimensionfrom the masking
                        process is collapsed.
  --collapse_dimension  Collapse the dimension from the mask, by doing a
                        weighted mean using the weights provided. This is only
                        suitable when the result is is left unmasked, so there
                        is data to weight between the points in coordinate we
                        are collapsing.
  --weights_for_collapsing_dim WEIGHTS
                        A path to an weights NetCDF file containing the
                        weights which are used for collapsing the dimension
                        gained through masking.
  --intermediate_filepath INTERMEDIATE_FILEPATH
                        If provided the result after neighbourhooding, before
                        collapsing the extra dimension is saved in the given
                        filepath.
