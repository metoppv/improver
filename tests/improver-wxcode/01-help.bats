Calculate gridded weather symbol codes.
This plugin requires a specific set of input diagnostics, where data
may be in any units to which the thresholds given below can
be converted:
 - probability_of_rainfall_rate_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.03 (mm hr-1), 0.1 (mm hr-1), 1.0 (mm hr-1)
 - probability_of_lwe_snowfall_rate_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.1 (mm hr-1), 1.0 (mm hr-1)
 - probability_of_cloud_area_fraction_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.1875 (1), 0.8125 (1)
 - probability_of_visibility_in_air_below_threshold; thresholds: 1000.0 (m), 5000.0 (m)
 - probability_of_low_type_cloud_area_fraction_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.85 (1)
 - probability_of_rainfall_rate_in_vicinity_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.1 (mm hr-1), 1.0 (mm hr-1)
 - probability_of_lwe_snowfall_rate_in_vicinity_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.1 (mm hr-1), 1.0 (mm hr-1)

 or for global data

 - probability_of_rainfall_rate_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.03 (mm hr-1), 0.1 (mm hr-1), 1.0 (mm hr-1)
 - probability_of_lwe_snowfall_rate_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.1 (mm hr-1), 1.0 (mm hr-1)
 - probability_of_cloud_area_fraction_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.1875 (1), 0.8125 (1)
 - probability_of_visibility_in_air_below_threshold; thresholds: 1000.0 (m), 5000.0 (m)
 - probability_of_low_type_cloud_area_fraction_above_threshold; thresholds: 0.85 (1)

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILES           Paths to files containing the required input diagnostics.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --wxtree WXTREE       Weather Code tree.
                        Choices are high_resolution or global.
                        Default=high_resolution.
