Determine grid point coordinates within the provided cubes that neighbour spot
data sites defined within the provided JSON file. If no options are set the
returned netCDF file will contain the nearest neighbour found for each site.
Other constrained neighbour finding methods can be set with options below.

These methods are:

 1. nearest neighbour
 2. nearest land point neighbour
 3. nearest neighbour with minimum height difference
 4. nearest land point neighbour with minimum height difference

positional arguments:
  SITE_LIST_FILEPATH    Path to a JSON file that contains the spot sites for
                        which neighbouring grid points are to be found.
  OROGRAPHY_FILEPATH    Path to a NetCDF file of model orography for the model
                        grid on which neighbours are being found.
  LANDMASK_FILEPATH     Path to a NetCDF file of model land mask for the model
                        grid on which neighbours are being found.
  OUTPUT_FILEPATH       The output path for the resulting NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --all_methods         If set this will return a cube containing the nearest
                        grid point neighbours to spot sites as defined by each
                        possible combination of constraints.

Apply constraints to neighbour choice:
  --land_constraint     If set this will return a cube containing the nearest
                        grid point neighbours to spot sites that are also land
                        points. May be used with the minimum_dz option.
  --minimum_dz          If set this will return a cube containing the nearest
                        grid point neighbour to each spot site that is found,
                        within a given search radius, to minimise the height
                        difference between the two. May be used with the
                        land_constraint option.
  --search_radius SEARCH_RADIUS
                        The radius in metres about a spot site within which to
                        search for a grid point neighbour that is land or
                        which has a smaller height difference than the
                        nearest. The default value is 10000m (10km).
  --node_limit NODE_LIMIT
                        When searching within the defined search_radius for
                        suitable neighbours, a KDTree is constructed. This
                        node_limit prevents the tree from becoming too large
                        for large search radii. A default of 36 is set, which
                        is to say the nearest 36 grid points will be
                        considered. If the search_radius is likely to contain
                        more than 36 points, this value should be increased to
                        ensure all points are considered.

Site list options:
  --site_coordinate_system SITE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM
                        The coordinate system in which the site coordinates
                        are provided within the site list. This must be
                        provided as the name of a cartopy coordinate system.
                        The default is a PlateCarree system, with site
                        coordinates given by latitude/longitude pairs. This
                        can be a complete definition, including parameters
                        required to modify a default system, e.g.
                        Miller(central_longitude=90). If a globe is required
                        this can be specified as e.g.
                        Globe(semimajor_axis=100, semiminor_axis=100).
  --site_coordinate_options SITE_COORDINATE_OPTIONS
                        JSON formatted string of options passed to the cartopy
                        coordinate system given in site_coordinate_system.
                        "globe" is handled as a special case for options to
                        construct a cartopy Globe object.
  --site_x_coordinate SITE_X_COORDINATE
                        The x coordinate key within the JSON file. The plugin
                        default is 'longitude', but can be changed using this
                        option if required.
  --site_y_coordinate SITE_Y_COORDINATE
                        The y coordinate key within the JSON file. The plugin
                        default is 'latitude', but can be changed using this
                        option if required.
