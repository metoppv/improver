                                    INPUT_FILE INPUT_MASK OUTPUT_FILE

Neighbourhood the input dataset over two distinct regions of land and sea. If
performed as a single level neighbourhood, a land-sea mask should be provided.
If instead topographic_zone neighbourhooding is being employed, the mask
should be one of topographic zones. In the latter case a weights array is also
needed to collapse the topographic_zone coordinate. These weights are created
with the improver generate-topography-bands-weights CLI and should be made
using a land-sea mask, which will then be employed within this code to draw
the distinction between the two surface types.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed.
  INPUT_MASK            A path to an input NetCDF file containing either a
                        mask of topographic zones over land or a land-sea
                        mask.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ens_factor ENS_FACTOR
                        The factor with which to adjust the neighbourhood size
                        for more than one ensemble realization. If ens_factor
                        = 1.0 this essentially conserves ensemble realizations
                        if every grid square is considered to be the
                        equivalent of an ensemble realization. Optional,
                        defaults to 1.0.
  --sum_or_fraction {sum,fraction}
                        The neighbourhood output can either be in the form of
                        a sum of the neighbourhood, or a fraction calculated
                        by dividing the sum of the neighbourhood by the
                        neighbourhood area. "fraction" is the default option.
  --intermediate_filepath INTERMEDIATE_FILEPATH
                        Intermediate filepath for results following
                        topographic masked neighbourhood processing of land
                        points and prior to collapsing the topographic_zone
                        coordinate. Intermediate files will not be produced if
                        no topographic masked neighbourhood processing occurs.

Collapse weights - required if using a topographic zones mask:
  --weights_for_collapsing_dim WEIGHTS
                        A path to an weights NetCDF file containing the
                        weights which are used for collapsing the dimension
                        gained through masking. These weights must have been
                        created using a land-sea mask.

Neighbourhooding Radius - Set only one of the options:
  --radius RADIUS       The radius (in m) for neighbourhood processing.
  --radii-by-lead-time RADII_BY_LEAD_TIME LEAD_TIME_IN_HOURS
                        The radii for neighbourhood processing and the
                        associated lead times at which the radii are valid.
                        The radii are in metres whilst the lead time has units
                        of hours. The radii and lead times are expected as
                        individual comma-separated lists with the list of
                        radii given first followed by a list of lead times to
                        indicate at what lead time each radii should be used.
                        For example: 10000,12000,14000 1,2,3 where a lead time
                        of 1 hour uses a radius of 10000m, a lead time of 2
                        hours uses a radius of 12000m, etc.
