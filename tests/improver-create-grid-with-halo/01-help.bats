                                      INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

Generate grid with halo from a source domain input file. The grid is populated
with zeroes.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            NetCDF file containing data on a source grid.
  OUTPUT_FILE           NetCDF file defining the target grid with additional
                        halo.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --halo_radius HALO_RADIUS
                        Size of halo (in m) with which to pad the input grid.
                        Default is 162 000 m.
