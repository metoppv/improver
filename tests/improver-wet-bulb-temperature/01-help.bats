Calculate a field of wet bulb temperatures.

positional arguments:
  TEMPERATURE           Path to a NetCDF file of air temperatures at the
                        points for which the wet bulb temperatures are being
                        calculated.
  RELATIVE_HUMIDITY     Path to a NetCDF file of relative humidities at the
                        points for for which the wet bulb temperatures are
                        being calculated.
  PRESSURE              Path to a NetCDF file of air pressures at the points
                        for which the wet bulb temperatures are being
                        calculated.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --convergence_condition CONVERGENCE_CONDITION
                        The convergence condition for the Newton iterator in
                        K. When the wet bulb temperature stops changing by
                        more than this amount between iterations, the solution
                        is accepted.
