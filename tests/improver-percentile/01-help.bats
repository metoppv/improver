                           INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

Calculate percentiled data over a given coordinate by collapsing that
coordinate. Typically used to convert realization (member) data into
percentiled data, but may calculate over any dimension coordinate.
Alternatively, calling this CLI with a dataset containing probabilities will
convert those to percentiles using the ensemble copula coupling plugin. If no
particular percentiles are given at which to calculate values and no 'number
of percentiles' to calculate are specified, the following defaults will be
used: [0, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, 95, 100]

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --coordinates COORDINATES_TO_COLLAPSE [COORDINATES_TO_COLLAPSE ...]
                        Coordinate or coordinates over which to collapse data
                        and calculate percentiles; e.g. 'realization' or
                        'latitude longitude'. This argument must be provided
                        when collapsing a coordinate or coordinates to create
                        percentiles, but is redundant when converting
                        probabilities to percentiles and may be omitted.
  --percentiles PERCENTILES [PERCENTILES ...]
                        Optional definition of percentiles at which to
                        calculate data, e.g. --percentiles 0 33.3 66.6 100
  --no-of-percentiles NUMBER_OF_PERCENTILES
                        Optional definition of the number of percentiles to be
                        generated, these distributed regularly with the aim of
                        dividing into blocks of equal probability.
