Apply the requested ensemble calibration method using the current forecast (to
be calibrated) in the form of realizations, probabilities, or percentiles,
historical forecasts in the form of realizations and historical truth data (to
use in calibration). The mean and variance output from the EnsembleCalibration
plugin can be written to an output file if required. If the current forecast
is supplied in the form of probabilities or percentiles, these are converted
to realizations prior to calibration. After calibration, the mean and variance
computed in the calibration are converted to match the format of the current
forecast i.e. if realizations are input, realizations are output, if
probabilities are input, probabilities are output, and if percentiles are
input, percentiles are output.If realizations are input, realizations are
regenerated using Ensemble Copula Coupling.

positional arguments:
  UNITS_TO_CALIBRATE_IN
                        The unit that calibration should be undertaken in. The
                        current forecast, historical forecast and truth will
                        be converted as required.
  DISTRIBUTION          The distribution that will be used for calibration.
                        This will be dependent upon the input phenomenon. This
                        has to be supported by the minimisation functions in
                        ContinuousRankedProbabilityScoreMinimisers.
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file containing the current
                        forecast to be processed. The file provided could be
                        in the form of realizations, probabilities or
                        percentiles.
  HISTORIC_DATA_FILE    A path to an input NetCDF file containing the historic
                        forecast(s) used for calibration. The file provided
                        must be in the form of realizations.
  TRUTH_DATA_FILE       A path to an input NetCDF file containing the historic
                        truth analyses used for calibration.
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --predictor_of_mean CALIBRATE_MEAN_FLAG
                        String to specify the input to calculate the
                        calibrated mean. Currently the ensemble mean ("mean")
                        and the ensemble realizations ("realizations") are
                        supported as the predictors. Default: "mean".
  --save_mean MEAN_FILE
                        Option to save the mean output from
                        EnsembleCalibration plugin. If used, a path to save
                        the output to must be provided.
  --save_variance VARIANCE_FILE
                        Option to save the variance output from
                        EnsembleCalibration plugin. If used, a path to save
                        the output to must be provided.
  --num_realizations NUMBER_OF_REALIZATIONS
                        Optional argument to specify the number of ensemble
                        realizations to produce. If the current forecast is
                        input as probabilities or percentiles then this
                        argument is used to create the requested number of
                        realizations. In addition, this argument is used to
                        construct the requested number of realizations from
                        the mean and variance output after applying the EMOS
                        coefficients.Default will be the number of
                        realizations in the raw input file, if realizations
                        are provided as input, otherwise if the input format
                        is probabilities or percentiles, then an error will be
                        raised if no value is provided.
  --random_ordering     Option to reorder the post-processed forecasts
                        randomly. If not set, the ordering of the raw ensemble
                        is used. This option is only valid when the input
                        format is realizations.
  --random_seed RANDOM_SEED
                        Option to specify a value for the random seed for
                        testing purposes, otherwise, the default random seed
                        behaviour is utilised. The random seed is used in the
                        generation of the random numbers used for either the
                        random_ordering option to order the input percentiles
                        randomly, rather than use the ordering from the raw
                        ensemble, or for splitting tied values within the raw
                        ensemble, so that the values from the input
                        percentiles can be ordered to match the raw ensemble.
  --ecc_bounds_warning  If True, where the percentiles exceed the ECC bounds
                        range, raise a warning rather than an exception. This
                        occurs when the current forecast is in the form of
                        probabilities and is converted to percentiles, as part
                        of converting the input probabilities into
                        realizations.
  --max_iterations MAX_ITERATIONS
                        The maximum number of iterations allowed until the
                        minimisation has converged to a stable solution. If
                        the maximum number of iterations is reached, but the
                        minimisation has not yet converged to a stable
                        solution, then the available solution is used anyway,
                        and a warning is raised. This may be modified for
                        testing purposes but otherwise kept fixed. If the
                        predictor_of_mean is "realizations", then the number
                        of iterations may require increasing, as there will be
                        more coefficients to solve for.
