                          [THRESHOLD_VALUES [THRESHOLD_VALUES ...]]

Calculate the threshold truth value of input data relative to the provided
threshold value. By default data are tested to be above the thresholds, though
the --below_threshold flag enables testing below thresholds. A fuzzy factor or
fuzzy bounds may be provided to capture data that is close to the threshold.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF
  THRESHOLD_VALUES      Threshold value or values about which to calculate the
                        truth values; e.g. 270 300. Must be omitted if
                        --threshold_config is used.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --threshold_config THRESHOLD_CONFIG
                        Threshold configuration JSON file containing
                        thresholds and fuzzy bounds. Best used in combination
                        with --threshold_units. It should contain a dictionary
                        of strings that can be interpreted as floats with the
                        structure: "THRESHOLD_VALUE": [LOWER_BOUND,
                        UPPER_BOUND] e.g: {"280.0": [278.0, 282.0], "290.0":
                        [288.0, 292.0]}. Repeated thresholds with different
                        bounds are not handled well. Only the last duplicate
                        will be used.
  --threshold_units THRESHOLD_UNITS
                        Units of the threshold values. If not provided the
                        units are assumed to be the same as those of the input
                        dataset. Specifying the units here will allow a
                        suitable conversion to match the input units if
                        possible.
  --below_threshold     By default truth values of 1 are returned for data
                        ABOVE the threshold value(s). Using this flag changes
                        this behaviour to return 1 for data below the
                        threshold values.
  --fuzzy_factor FUZZY_FACTOR
                        A decimal fraction defining the factor about the
                        threshold value(s) which should be treated as fuzzy.
                        Data which fail a test against the hard threshold
                        value may return a fractional truth value if they fall
                        within this fuzzy factor region. Fuzzy factor must be
                        in the range 0-1, with higher values indicating a
                        narrower fuzzy factor region / sharper threshold. NB A
                        fuzzy factor cannot be used with a zero threshold or a
                        threshold_config file.
