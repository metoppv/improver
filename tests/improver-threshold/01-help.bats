                          [THRESHOLD_VALUES [THRESHOLD_VALUES ...]]

Calculate the threshold truth value of input data relative to the provided
threshold value. By default data are tested to be above the thresholds, though
the --below_threshold flag enables testing below thresholds. A fuzzy factor or
fuzzy bounds may be provided to capture data that is close to the threshold.

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF
  THRESHOLD_VALUES      Threshold value or values about which to calculate the
                        truth values; e.g. 270 300. Must be omitted if
                        --threshold_config is used.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --threshold_config THRESHOLD_CONFIG
                        Threshold configuration JSON file containing
                        thresholds and (optionally) fuzzy bounds. Best used in
                        combination with --threshold_units. It should contain
                        a dictionary of strings that can be interpreted as
                        floats with the structure: "THRESHOLD_VALUE":
                        [LOWER_BOUND, UPPER_BOUND] e.g: {"280.0": [278.0,
                        282.0], "290.0": [288.0, 292.0]}, or with structure
                        "THRESHOLD_VALUE": "None" (no fuzzy bounds). Repeated
                        thresholds with different bounds are not handled well.
                        Only the last duplicate will be used.
  --threshold_units THRESHOLD_UNITS
                        Units of the threshold values. If not provided the
                        units are assumed to be the same as those of the input
                        dataset. Specifying the units here will allow a
                        suitable conversion to match the input units if
                        possible.
  --comparison_operator COMPARISON_OPERATOR
                        Indicates the comparison_operator to use with the
                        threshold. e.g. 'ge' or '>=' to evaluate data >=
                        threshold or '<' to evaluate data < threshold. When
                        using fuzzy thresholds, there is no difference between
                        < and <= or > and >=.Default is >. Valid choices: > >=
                        < <= gt ge lt le.
  --fuzzy_factor FUZZY_FACTOR
                        A decimal fraction defining the factor about the
                        threshold value(s) which should be treated as fuzzy.
                        Data which fail a test against the hard threshold
                        value may return a fractional truth value if they fall
                        within this fuzzy factor region. Fuzzy factor must be
                        in the range 0-1, with higher values indicating a
                        narrower fuzzy factor region / sharper threshold. NB A
                        fuzzy factor cannot be used with a zero threshold or a
                        threshold_config file.
  --collapse-coord COLLAPSE-COORD
                        An optional ability to set which coordinate we want to
                        collapse over. The default is set to None.
  --vicinity VICINITY   If set, distance in metres used to define the vicinity
                        within which to search for an occurrence.
