improver tests [OPTIONS] [SUBTEST...]

Run pycodestyle, pylint, documentation, unit and CLI acceptance tests.

Optional arguments:
    --bats          Run CLI tests using BATS instead of the default prove
    --debug         Run in verbose mode (may take longer for CLI)
    -h, --help      Show this message and exit

Arguments:
    SUBTEST         Name(s) of a subtest to run without running the rest.
                    Valid names are: pycodestyle, pylint, pylintE, doc, unit, cli.
                    pycodestyle, pylintE, doc, unit, and cli are the default tests.
    SUBCLI          Name(s) of cli subtests to run without running the rest.
                    Valid names are tasks which appear in /improver/tests/
                    without the "improver-" prefix. The default is to run all
                    cli tests in the /improver/tests/ directory.
                    e.g. 'improver tests cli nbhood' will run neighbourhood
                    processing cli tests only.
