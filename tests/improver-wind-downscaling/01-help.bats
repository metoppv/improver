Run wind downscaling to apply roughness correction and height correction to
wind fields (as described in Howard and Clark [2007]). All inputs must be on
the same standard grid

positional arguments:
  WIND_SPEED_FILE       Location of the wind speed on standard grid file. Any
                        units can be supplied.
  AOS_FILE              Location of model silhouette roughness file. Units of
                        field: dimensionless
  SIGMA_FILE            Location of standard deviation of model orography
                        height file. Units of field: m
  TARGET_OROGRAPHY_FILE
                        Location of target orography file to downscale fields
                        to.Units of field: m
  STANDARD_OROGRAPHY_FILE
                        Location of orography on standard grid file
                        (interpolated model orography. Units of field: m
  MODEL_RESOLUTION      Original resolution of model orography (before
                        interpolation to standard grid). Units of field: m
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output_height_level OUTPUT_HEIGHT_LEVEL
                        If only a single height level is desired as output
                        from wind-downscaling, this option can be used to
                        select the height level. If no units are provided with
                        the --output_height_level_units option, metres are
                        assumed.
  --output_height_level_units OUTPUT_HEIGHT_LEVEL_UNITS
                        If a single height level is selected as output using
                        the --output_height_level option, this additional
                        argument may be used to specify the units of the value
                        entered to select the level. e.g. hPa
  --height_levels_filepath HEIGHT_LEVELS_FILE
                        Location of file containing height levels coincident
                        with wind speed field.
  --veg_roughness_filepath VEGETATIVE_ROUGHNESS_LENGTH_FILE
                        Location of vegetative roughness length file. Units of
                        field: m
