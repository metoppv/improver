    Wrap all tests with a limit to one thread via threadpoolctl.

    The threadpoolctl library handles a variety of numerical libraries including
    OpenBLAS, MKL and OpenMP, using their library specific interfaces during runtime.
    Environment variable settings for these need to be applied before starting the
    python interpreter, which is not possible from inside pytest.
    This limitation to one thread avoids thread contention when parallel processing
    is handled at larger scale such as Dask or pytest-xdist. See dask documentation:
    https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array-best-practices.html#avoid-oversubscribing-threads
