    The algorithm outputs the probability of at least one lightning strike within
    20 km of the location in a three hour period. The probabilities are calculated
    for each individual ensemble member, and then they are averaged for the ensemble
    probability forecast.

    Inputs:
    Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE in J/kg. Most Unstable CAPE is ideal and was used
    to determine the regression statistics, but surface-based CAPE is supported and yields similar
    results but will not forecast elevated convection.)
    Lifted Index (liftind in K)
    Precipitable Water (pwat in kg m-2 or mm. This is used as mm in the regression equations)
    Convective Inhibition (CIN in J/kg)
    3-hour Accumulated Precipitation (apcp in kg m-2 or millimetres)
    Outputs:
    20 km lightning probability over the valid time of the accumulated precipitation


    Description of the algorithm:

    Regression equation when CAPE and APCP are greater than zero:
    lprob= cape*APCP
    lprob=0.13*ln(lprob+0.7)+0.05

    If APCP is very low, a separate regression equation is used to predict lightning probability.
    The definition of “very low” is raised slightly when PWAT values are high. This is because
    the model often produces showery precipitation that doesn’t access the actual instability in
    very moist environments:
    lprob_noprecip=CAPE/(CIN+100.0)
    lprob_noprecip=0.025*ln(lprob_noprecip+0.31)+0.03
    APCP=APCP-(PWAT/1000)

    IF APCP is less than 0.01 inches THEN lprob=lprob_noprecip
    If there is no CAPE but the atmosphere is “close” to unstable, lightning does sometimes occur,
    especially when heavy precipitation may have stabilized the atmosphere in the model. Unstable
    values of lifted index are positive here:
    LIFTIDX=LIFTIDX+4.0
    IF LIFTIDX is less than 0 K THEN LIFTIDX=0.0
    IF CAPE<=0 J/kg THEN lprob=0.2*(LIFTIDX*APCP)^0.5

    Finally, the probability of lightning is reduced when there is not much PW, because graupel
    cannot form and start the whole charging process. Therefore we reduce the probability:
    IF PWAT is less than 20 mm THEN lprob=lprob*(PWAT/20.0)

    Limit final probabilities to 95% as that is as skillful as the regression equations could get:
    IF lprob is greater than 0.95 THEN lprob=0.95
