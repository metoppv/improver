    """Plugin that returns the modal category over the period spanned by the
    input data. In cases of a tie in the mode values, scipy returns the smaller
    value. The opposite is desirable in this case as the significance /
    importance of the weather code categories generally increases with the value. To
    achieve this the categories are subtracted from an arbitrarily larger
    number prior to calculating the mode, and this operation is reversed before the
    final output is returned.

    If there are many different categories for a single point over the time
    spanned by the input cubes it may be that the returned mode is not robust.
    Given the preference to return more significant categories explained above,
    a 12 hour period with 12 different categories, one of which is severe, will
    return that severe category to describe the whole period. This is likely not a
    good representation. In these cases grouping is used to try and select
    a suitable category (e.g. a rain shower if the codes include a mix of
    rain showers and dynamic rain) by providing a more robust mode. The lowest
    number (least significant) member of the group is returned as the code.
    Use of the least significant member reflects the lower certainty in the
    forecasts.

    Where there are different categories available for night and day, the
    modal code returned is always a day code, regardless of the times
    covered by the input files.
