        1. Estimate a scale factor for the relationship between the difference in
        altitude between the grid point and the site, and the natural log of the
        forecast divided by the truth, where s is the scale factor in the equations
        below.

            dz = \\ln(forecast / truth) \\times s

        2. Rearranging this equation gives:

        .. math::

            truth = forecast / \\exp(s \\times dz)

        or alternatively:

        .. math::

            truth = forecast \\times \\exp(-s \\times dz)

        This plugin is aiming to estimate the :math:`\\exp(-s \\times dz)` component,
