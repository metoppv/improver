        Ensemble forecasts must be in realization representation. Deterministic forecasts
        can be processed to produce a pseudo-ensemble; a realization dimension will be added
        to deterministic forecast cubes if one is not already present.

        The calibration is done in a situation dependent fashion using a series of
        decision-tree models to construct representative error distributions which are
        then used to map each input ensemble member onto a series of realisable values.

        These error distributions are formed in a two-step process:

        1. Evalute error CDF defined over the specified error_thresholds. Each exceedence
        probability is evaluated using the corresponding decision-tree model.

        2. Interpolate the CDF to extract a series of percentiles for the error distribution.
        The error percentiles are then applied to each associated ensemble realization to
        produce a series of realisable values; collectively these series form a calibrated
        super-ensemble, which is then sub-sampled to provide the calibrated forecast.

        Args:
            forecast_cube:
                Cube containing the forecast to be calibrated; must be as realizations.

                Cubelist containing the feature variables (physical parameters) used as inputs
                to the tree-models for the generation of the associated error distributions.
                Feature cubes are expected to have the same dimensions as forecast_cube, with
                the exception of the realization dimension. Where the feature_cube contains a
                realization dimension this is expected to be consistent, otherwise the cube will
                be broadcast along the realization dimension.

                The number of error percentiles to extract from the associated error CDFs
                evaluated via the tree-models. These error percentiles are applied to each
                ensemble realization to produce a series of values, which collectively form
                the super-ensemble. The resulting super-ensemble will be of
                size = forecast.realization.size * error_percentiles_count.
            output_realizations_count:
                The number of ensemble realizations that will be extracted from the
                super-ensemble. If realizations_count is None, all realizations will
                be returned.
