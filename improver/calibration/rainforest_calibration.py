            Within the RainForests approach we work with an additive error correction
            as opposed to a multiplicative correction used in ECPoint. The advantage of
            using an additive error is that we are also able to calibrate zero-values in
            the input forecast.

        Warning:

            After applying the error distributions to the forecast cube, values outside
            the expected bounds of the forecast parameter can arise. These values occur when
            when the input forecast value is between error thresholds and there exists a
            lower bound on the observable value (eg. 0 in the case of rainfall).

            In this situation, error thresholds below the residual value (min(obs) - fcst)
            must have a probability of exceedance of 1, whereas as error thresholds above
            this value can take on any value between [0, 1]. In the subsequent step where
            error percentile values are extracted, the linear interpolation in mapping from
            probabilities to percentiles can give percentile values that lie below the
            residual value; when these are applied to the forecast value, they result in

        The error percentiles are then applied to each associated ensemble realization to
