        Ensemble forecasts must be in realization representation. Deterministic forecasts
        can be processed to produce a pseudo-ensemble; a realization dimension will be added
        to deterministic forecast cubes if one is not already present.

        The calibration is done in a situation dependent fashion using a series of
        decision-tree models to construct representative error distributions which are
        then used to map each input ensemble member onto a series of realisable values.

        These error distributions are formed in a two-step process:

        1. Evaluate error CDF defined over the specified error_thresholds. Each exceedence
        probability is evaluated using the corresponding decision-tree model.

        2. Interpolate the CDF to extract a series of percentiles for the error distribution.
        The error percentiles are then applied to each associated ensemble realization to
        produce an error distribution. Distributions for different ensemble members are
        then interpolated to the same set of output thresholds and averaged in probability space.

                the exception of the realization dimension. Where the feature_cube contains a
                realization dimension this is expected to be consistent, otherwise the cube will
