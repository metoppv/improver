    """Estimate a scaling factor to account for a correction linked to the difference
    in altitude between the grid point and the site location.

    Args:
        forecast (iris.cube.Cube):
            Historical percentile forecasts. A 50th percentile forecast is required.
        truth (iris.cube.Cube):
            Truths that are expected to match the validity times of the forecasts.
        neighbour_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            The neighbour cube is a cube of spot-data neighbours and
            the spot site information.
        forecast_period (int):
            The forecast period that is considered representative of
            the input forecasts. This is required as the input forecasts could
            contain multiple forecast periods.
        dz_lower_bound (float):
            The lowest acceptable value for the difference in altitude
            between the grid point and the site. Sites with a lower
            (or more negative) difference in altitude will be excluded.
            If the altitude difference is calculated as site altitude minus the
            grid point altitude, the lower bound therefore indicates how far below
            the orographic surface (i.e. within unresolved valleys) the correction
            should be applied. Defaults to None.
        dz_upper_bound (float):
            The highest acceptable value for the difference in altitude
            between the grid point and the site. Sites with a larger
            positive difference in altitude will be excluded.
            If the altitude difference is calculated as site altitude minus the
            grid point altitude, the upper bound therefore indicates how far above
            the orographic surface (i.e. on unresolved hills or mountains) the
            correction should be applied. Defaults to None.
        land_constraint (bool):
            Use to select the nearest-with-land-constraint neighbour-selection
            method from the neighbour_cube. This means that the grid points
            should be land points except for sites where none were found within
            the search radius when the neighbour cube was created. May be used
            with similar_altitude.
        similar_altitude (bool):
            Use to select the nearest-with-height-constraint neighbour-selection
            method from the neighbour_cube. These are grid points that were found
            to be the closest in altitude to the spot site within the search radius
            defined when the neighbour cube was created. May be used with
            land_constraint.
        site_id_coord (str):
            The name of the site ID coordinate. This defaults to 'wmo_id'.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Cube containing a scaling factor computed using the difference
            in altitude between the grid point and the site location.
