    Aggregate multiple reliability calibration tables and/or aggregate over
    coordinates within the table(s) to produce a new reliability calibration
    table.

    Args:
        cubes (list of iris.cube.Cube):
            The cube or cubes containing the reliability calibration tables
            to aggregate.
        coordinates (list):
            A list of coordinates over which to aggregate the reliability
            calibration table using summation. If the list is empty
            and a single cube is provided, this cube will be returned
