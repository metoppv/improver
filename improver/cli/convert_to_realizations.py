    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube to be processed.
        raw_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of raw (not post processed) weather data.
            If this argument is given ensemble realizations will be created
            from percentiles by reshuffling them in correspondence to the rank
            order of the raw ensemble. Otherwise, the percentiles are rebadged
            as realizations.
        realizations_count (int):
            The number of ensemble realizations in the output.
        random_seed (int):
            Option to specify a value for the random seed for testing
            purposes, otherwise the default random seed behaviours is
            utilised. The random seed is used in the generation of the
            random numbers used for splitting tied values within the raw
            ensemble, so that the values from the input percentiles can
            be ordered to match the raw ensemble.
        ignore_ecc_bounds (bool):
            If True, where percentiles exceed the ECC bounds range, raises a
            warning rather than an exception.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            The processed cube.
