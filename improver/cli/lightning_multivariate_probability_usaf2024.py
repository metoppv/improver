    From the supplied following cubes:
    Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE in J/kg),
    Lifted Index (liftind in K),
    Precipitable Water (pwat in kg m-2 or mm. This is used as mm in the regression equations),
    Convective Inhibition (CIN in J/kg),
    3-hour Accumulated Precipitation (apcp in kg m-2 or millimetres),
    calculate a probability of lightning cube using relationships developed using regression
    statistics.

    The cubes for CAPE, lifted index, precipitable water, and CIN must be valid for the beginning
    of the 3-hr accumulated precipitation window.

    Does not collapse a realization coordinate.
