    """Regrids source cube data onto a target grid. Optional land-sea awareness.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Source cube to be regridded.
        target_grid (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube defining the spatial grid onto which to regrid the source data.
            If also using land_sea_mask-aware regridding then this must be
            land_binary_mask data.
        land_sea_mask (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube describing the land_binary_mask on the source grid if land-sea
            aware regridding is required, with land points set to one and sea points
            set to zero. This can be a larger domain than cube, so long as cube is
            a strict cut-out (not a reprojection) of the land_sea_mask domain.
        regrid_mode (str):
            Selects which regridding techniques to use. Default uses
            iris.analysis.Linear(); "nearest" uses iris.analysis.Nearest();
            "nearest-with-mask" uses Nearest() with land-sea awareness.
            "nearest-2": new/fast version without using Iris
            "nearest-with-mask-2": new super-fast version without using Iris
            "bilinear-with-mask": bilinear option with land-sea mask considered
        extrapolation_mode (str):
            Mode to use for extrapolating data into regions beyond the limits
            of the input cube domain. Refer to online documentation for
            iris.analysis.
            Modes are -
            extrapolate - extrapolated points will take their values from the
            nearest source point
            nan - extrapolated points will be set to NaN
            error - a ValueError will be raised notifying an attempt to
            extrapolate
            mask - extrapolated points will always be masked, even if
            the source data is not a MaskedArray
            nanmask - if the source data is a MaskedArray extrapolated points
            will be masked; otherwise they will be set to NaN
        land_sea_mask_vicinity (float):
            Radius of vicinity to search for a coastline, in metres.
        regridded_title (str):
            New "title" attribute to be set if the field is being regridded
            (since "title" may contain grid information). If None, a default
            value is used.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Processed cube.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If source land_sea_mask is supplied but regrid mode is not
            "nearest-with-mask".
        ValueError:
            If regrid_mode is "nearest-with-mask" but no source land_sea_mask
            is provided (from plugin).
