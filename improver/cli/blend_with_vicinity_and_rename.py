    """Runs weighted blending, with additional options to handle mismatched in_vicinity coords
    and to apply a new name to the output cube.

    Check for inconsistent arguments, then calculate a weighted blend
    of input cube data using the options specified.

    Args:
        cubes (iris.cube.CubeList):
            Cubelist of cubes to be blended.
        coordinate (str):
            The coordinate over which the blending will be applied.
        new_name (str):
            Replaces cube.name() on the output cube.
        vicinity_radius (float):
            The data value associated with the vicinity coord on the output cube.
            Assumes same units as the x and y spatial coordinates.
        weighting_method (str):
            Method to use to calculate weights used in blending.
            "linear" (default): calculate linearly varying blending weights.
            "nonlinear": calculate blending weights that decrease
            exponentially with increasing blending coordinates.
            "dict": calculate weights using a dictionary passed in.
        weighting_coord (str):
            Name of coordinate over which linear weights should be scaled.
            This coordinate must be available in the weights dictionary.
        weighting_config (dict or None):
            Dictionary from which to calculate blending weights. Dictionary
            format is as specified in
            improver.blending.weights.ChoosingWeightsLinear
        attributes_config (dict):
            Dictionary describing required changes to attributes after blending
        cycletime (str):
            The forecast reference time to be used after blending has been
            applied, in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ. If not provided, the
            blended file takes the latest available forecast reference time
            from the input datasets supplied.
        y0val (float):
            The relative value of the weighting start point (lowest value of
            blend coord) for choosing default linear weights.
            If used this must be a positive float or 0.
        ynval (float):
            The relative value of the weighting end point (highest value of
            blend coord) for choosing default linear weights. This must be a
            positive float or 0.
            Note that if blending over forecast reference time, ynval >= y0val
            would normally be expected (to give greater weight to the more
            recent forecast).
        cval (float):
            Factor used to determine how skewed the non-linear weights will be.
            A value of 1 implies equal weighting.
        model_id_attr (str):
            The name of the dataset attribute to be used to identify the source
            model when blending data from different models.
        record_run_attr:
            The name of the dataset attribute to be used to store model and
            cycle sources in metadata, e.g. when blending data from different
            models. Requires model_id_attr.
        spatial_weights_from_mask (bool):
            If True, this option will result in the generation of spatially
            varying weights based on the masks of the data we are blending.
            The one dimensional weights are first calculated using the chosen
            weights calculation method, but the weights will then be adjusted
            spatially based on where there is masked data in the data we are
            blending. The spatial weights are calculated using the
            SpatiallyVaryingWeightsFromMask plugin.
        fuzzy_length (float):
            When calculating spatially varying weights we can smooth the
            weights so that areas close to areas that are masked have lower
            weights than those further away. This fuzzy length controls the
            scale over which the weights are smoothed. The fuzzy length is in
            terms of m, the default is 20km. This distance is then converted
            into a number of grid squares, which does not have to be an
            integer. Assumes the grid spacing is the same in the x and y
            directions and raises an error if this is not true. See
            SpatiallyVaryingWeightsFromMask for more details.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Merged and blended Cube.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError:
            If calc_method is linear and cval is not None.
        RuntimeError:
            If calc_method is nonlinear and either y0val and ynval is not None.
        RuntimeError:
            If calc_method is dict and weights_dict is None.
