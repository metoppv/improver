    cubes by lowering the probabilities in the forecast cube to be less than or
    equal to the reference forecast.

    Args:
        cubes (iris.cube.CubeList or list of iris.cube.Cube):
            containing:
                forecast_cube (iris.cube.Cube):

                    Cube of probabilities used as the upper cap for
                    forecast_cube probabilities. It must be the same shape as
                    forecast_cube but have a different name.

        ref_name (str):
            Name of ref_forecast cube
        diff_for_warning (float):
            A float between 0 and 1. If assigned, the plugin will raise a warning
            if the forecast probabilities are decreased by more than this value.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Cube with identical metadata to forecast_cube but with
            lowered probabilities to be less than or equal to the
