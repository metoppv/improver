            A cubelist containing categorical cubes that cover the period

            A JSON file containing a decision tree definition.
        model_id_attr (str):
            Name of attribute recording source models that should be
            inherited by the output cube. The source models are expected as
            a space-separated string.
        record_run_attr:
            Name of attribute used to record models and cycles used in
            constructing the categorical data.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            A cube of modal categories over a period.
