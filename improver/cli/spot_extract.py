    """Module to run spot data extraction.

    Extract diagnostic data from gridded fields for spot data sites. It is
    possible to apply a temperature lapse rate adjustment to temperature data
    that helps to account for differences between the spot site's real altitude
    and that of the grid point from which the temperature data is extracted.

    Args:
        neighbour_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of spot-data neighbours and the spot site information.
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing the diagnostic data to be extracted.
        lapse_rate (iris.cube.Cube):
            Optional cube containing temperature lapse rates. If this cube is
            provided and a screen temperature cube is being processed, the
            lapse rates will be used to adjust the temperature to better
            represent each spot's site-altitude.
        apply_lapse_rate_correction (bool):
            Use to apply a lapse-rate correction to screen temperature data so
            that the data are a better match the altitude of the spot site for
            which they have been extracted.
        land_constraint (bool):
            Use to select the nearest-with-land-constraint neighbour-selection
            method from the neighbour_cube. This means that the grid points
            should be land points except for sites where none were found within
            the search radius when the neighbour cube was created. May be used
            with similar_altitude.
        similar_altitude (bool):
            Use to select the nearest-with-height-constraint
            neighbour-selection method from the neighbour_cube. These are grid
            points that were found to be the closest in altitude to the spot
            site within the search radius defined when the neighbour cube was
            created. May be used with land_constraint.
        extract_percentiles (list or int):
            If set to a percentile value or a list of percentile values,
            data corresponding to those percentiles will be returned. For
            example "25, 50, 75" will result in the 25th, 50th and 75th
            percentiles being returned from a cube of probabilities,
            percentiles or realizations. Deterministic input data will raise
            a warning message.
            Note that for percentiles inputs, the desired percentile(s) must
            exist in the input cube.
        ignore_ecc_bounds (bool):
            Demotes exceptions where calculated percentiles are outside the ECC
            bounds range to warnings.
        new_title (str):
            New title for the spot-extracted data.  If None, this attribute is
            removed from the output cube since it has no prescribed standard
            and may therefore contain grid information that is no longer
            correct after spot-extraction.
        suppress_warnings (bool):
            Suppress warning output. This option should only be used if it
            is known that warnings will be generated but they are not required.
        realization_collapse (bool):
            Triggers equal-weighting blending of the realization coord if required.
            Use this if a threshold coord is also present on the input cube.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
           Cube of spot data.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If the percentile diagnostic cube does not contain the requested
            percentile value.
        ValueError:
            If the lapse rate cube was provided but the diagnostic being
            processed is not air temperature.
        ValueError:
            If the lapse rate cube provided does not have the name
            "air_temperature_lapse_rate"
        ValueError:
            If the lapse rate cube does not contain a single valued height
            coordinate.

    Warns:
        warning:
           If diagnostic cube is not a known probabilistic type.
        warning:
            If a lapse rate cube was provided, but the height of the
            temperature does not match that of the data used.
        warning:
            If a lapse rate cube was not provided, but the option to apply
            the lapse rate correction was enabled.
