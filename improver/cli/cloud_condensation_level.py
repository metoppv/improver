    """Module to generate cloud condensation level.

    Calls the HumidityMixingRatio plugin to calculate humidity mixing ratio from relative humidity.

    Calls the CloudCondensationLevel plugin to calculate cloud condensation level.

    Args:
        cubes (iris.cube.CubeList or list of iris.cube.Cube):
            containing near-surface values, in this order, of:
                temperature (iris.cube.Cube):
                    Cube of air_temperature (K).
                pressure (iris.cube.Cube):
                    Cube of surface_air_pressure (Pa).
                humidity (iris.cube.Cube):
                    Cube of relative_humidity (1).
        model_id_attr (str):
            Name of the attribute used to identify the source model for blending.

    Returns:
        tuple:
