    """Estimate coefficients for Ensemble Model Output Statistics.

    Loads in arguments for estimating coefficients for Ensemble Model
    Output Statistics (EMOS), otherwise known as Non-homogeneous Gaussian
    Regression (NGR). Two sources of input data must be provided: historical
    forecasts and historical truth data (to use in calibration).
    The estimated coefficients are output as a cube.

    Args:
        cubes (list of iris.cube.Cube):
            A list of cubes containing the historical forecasts and
            corresponding truth used for calibration. They must have the same
            cube name and will be separated based on the truth attribute.
            Optionally this may also contain a single land-sea mask cube on the
            same domain as the historic forecasts and truth (where land points
            are set to one and sea points are set to zero).
        distribution (str):
            The distribution that will be used for calibration. This will be
            dependant upon the input phenomenon.
        truth_attribute (str):
            An attribute and its value in the format of "attribute=value",
            which must be present on historical truth cubes.
        cycletime (str):
            This denotes the cycle at which forecasts will be calibrated using
            the calculated EMOS coefficients. The validity time in the output
            coefficients cube will be calculated relative to this cycletime.
            This cycletime is in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ.
        units (str):
            The units that calibration should be undertaken in. The historical
            forecast and truth will be converted as required.
        predictor_of_mean (str):
            String to specify the input to calculate the calibrated mean.
            Currently the ensemble mean ("mean") and the ensemble realizations
            ("realizations") are supported as the predictors.
        tolerance (float):
            The tolerance for the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
            calculated by the minimisation. Once multiple iterations result in
            a CRPS equal to the same value within the specified tolerance, the
            minimisation will terminate.
        max_iterations (int):
            The maximum number of iterations allowed until the minimisation has
            converged to a stable solution. If the maximum number of iterations
            is reached but the minimisation has not yet converged to a stable
            solution, then the available solution is used anyway, and a warning
            is raised.
            If the predictor_of_mean is "realizations", then the number of
            iterations may require increasing, as there will be more
            coefficients to solve.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Cube containing the coefficients estimated using EMOS. The cube
            contains a coefficient_index dimension coordinate and a
            coefficient_name auxiliary coordinate.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError:
            An unexpected number of distinct cube names were passed in.
        RuntimeError:
            More than one cube was identified as a land-sea mask.
        RuntimeError:
            Missing truth or historical forecast in input cubes.
