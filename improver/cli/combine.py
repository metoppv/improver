    r"""Combine input cubes.

    Combine the input cubes into a single cube using the requested operation.
    The first cube in the input list provides the template for output metadata.
    If coordinates are expanded as a result of this combine operation
    (e.g. expanding time for accumulations / max in period) the upper bound of
    the new coordinate will also be used as the point for the new coordinate.

    Args:
        cubes (iris.cube.CubeList or list of iris.cube.Cube):
            An iris CubeList to be combined.
        operation (str):
            An operation to use in combining input cubes. One of:
            +, -, \*, add, subtract, multiply, min, max, mean
        new_name (str):
            New name for the resulting dataset.
        broadcast_to_threshold (bool):
            If True, broadcast input cubes to the threshold coord prior to combining -
            a threshold coord must already exist on the first input cube.
        minimum_realizations (int):
            If specified, the input cubes will be filtered to ensure that only realizations that
            include all available lead times are combined. If the number of realizations that
            meet this criteria are fewer than this integer, an error will be raised.

    Returns:
        result (iris.cube.Cube):
            Returns a cube with the combined data.
