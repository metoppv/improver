    r"""Collapses cube coordinates and calculate percentiled data.

    Calculate percentiled data over a given coordinate by collapsing that
    coordinate. Typically used to convert realization data into percentiled
    data, but may calculate over any dimension coordinate. Alternatively
    calling this with a dataset containing probabilities will convert those
    to percentiles using the ensemble coupla coupling plugin. If no particular
    percentiles are given at which to calculate values and no
    'number of percentiles' to calculate are specified, the
    following defaults will be used.
    '[0, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, 95, 100]'

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A Cube for processing.
        coordinates (str or list):
            Coordinate or coordinates over which to collapse data and
            calculate percentiles; e.g. 'realization' or 'latitude,longitude'.
            This argument must be provided when collapsing a coordinate or
            coordinates to create percentiles, but is redundant when
            converting probabilities to percentiles and may be omitted. This
            coordinate(s) will be removed and replaced by a percentile
            coordinate.
        percentiles (list):
            Optional definition of percentiles at which to calculate data.
        ignore_ecc_bounds (bool):
            If True, where calculated percentiles are outside the ECC bounds
            range, raises a warning rather than an exception.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            The processed Cube.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If the cube name does not contain 'probability_of\_' and
            coordinates isn't used.

    Warns:
        Warning:
            If 'probability_of\_' is in the cube name and coordinates is used.
