    Calculates a probability of freezing-rain near the ground using rain, sleet,
    and temperature probabilities.

    P(freezing_rain rate or accumulation > threshold) = (
        (P(rain rate or accumulation >  threshold) +
         P(sleet rate or accumulation >  threshold)) * P(temperature < 0C)

    Args:
        cubes (iris.cube.CubeList or list):
            Contains cubes of rain, sleet, and temperature probabilities. The
            precipitation cubes may be either rates or accumulations. The
            temperature should be a surface or screen temperature. It may be a
            period minimum, with a period that matches the precipitation
            accumulation period, or an instantaneous temperature if using
            precipitation rates.
        model_id_attr (str):
            Name of the attribute used to identify the source model for
            blending.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            A cube of freezing rain rate or accumulation probabilities.
