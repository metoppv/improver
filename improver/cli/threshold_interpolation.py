    Use this CLI to modify the probability thresholds in an existing probability
    forecast cube by linearly interpolating between the existing thresholds.

    Args:
        forecast_at_thresholds:
            Cube expected to contain a threshold coordinate.
        threshold_values:
            The desired output thresholds, either as a list of float values or a
            single float value.
        threshold_config:
            Threshold configuration containing threshold values. It should contain
            either a list of float values or a dictionary of strings that can be
            interpreted as floats with the structure: "THRESHOLD_VALUE": "None".
            The latter follows the format expected in improver/cli/threshold.py,
            however fuzzy bounds will be ignored here.
            Repeated thresholds with different bounds are ignored; only the
            last duplicate will be used.
            Threshold_values and threshold_config are mutually exclusive
            arguments, defining both will lead to an exception.
        threshold_units:
            Units of the threshold values. If not provided the units are
            assumed to be the same as those of the input cube.

    Returns:
        Cube with forecast values at the desired set of thresholds.
        The threshold coordinate is always the zeroth dimension.
