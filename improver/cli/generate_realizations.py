    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube to be processed.
        raw_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of raw (not post processed) weather data.
            If this argument is given ensemble realizations will be created
            from percentiles by reshuffling them in correspondence to the rank
            order of the raw ensemble. Otherwise, the percentiles are rebadged
            as realizations.
        realizations_count (int):
            The number of ensemble realizations in the output.
        random_seed (int):
            Option to specify a value for the random seed when reordering percentiles.
            This value is for testing purposes only, to ensure reproduceable outputs.
            It should not be used in real time operations as it may introduce a bias
            into the reordered forecasts.
        ignore_ecc_bounds (bool):
            If True where percentiles (calculated as an intermediate output
            before realization) exceed the ECC bounds range, raises a
            warning rather than an exception.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            The processed cube.
