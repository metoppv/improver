    """Runs neighbourhood processing.

    Apply the requested neighbourhood method via the
    NeighbourhoodProcessing plugin to a Cube.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            The Cube to be processed.
        mask (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube to mask the input cube. The data should contain 1 for
            usable points and 0 for discarded points.
            Only supported with square neighbourhoods. (Optional)
        neighbourhood_output (str):
            The form of the results generated using neighbourhood processing.
            If "probabilities" is selected, the mean probability with a
            neighbourhood is calculated. If "percentiles" is selected, then
            the percentiles are calculated with a neighbourhood. Calculating
            percentiles from a neighbourhood is only supported for a circular
            neighbourhood.
            Options: "probabilities", "percentiles".
        neighbourhood_shape (str):
            Name of the neighbourhood method to use. Only a "circular"
            neighbourhood shape is applicable for calculating "percentiles"
            output.
            Options: "circular", "square".
        radii (list of float):
            The radius or a list of radii in metres of the neighbourhood to
            apply.
            If it is a list, it must be the same length as lead_times, which
            defines at which lead time to use which nbhood radius. The radius
            will be interpolated for intermediate lead times.
        lead_times (list of int):
            The lead times in hours that correspond to the radii to be used.
            If lead_times are set, radii must be a list the same length as
            lead_times.
        degrees_as_complex (bool):
            Include this option to process angles as complex numbers.
            Not compatible with circular kernel or percentiles.
        weighted_mode (bool):
            Include this option to set the weighting to decrease with radius.
            Otherwise a constant weighting is assumed.
            weighted_mode is only applicable for calculating "probability"
            neighbourhood output using the circular kernel.
        area_sum (bool):
            Return sum rather than fraction over the neighbourhood area.
        remask (bool):
            Include this option to apply the original un-neighbourhood
            processed mask to the neighbourhood processed cube.
            Otherwise the original un-neighbourhood processed mask
            is not applied. Therefore, the neighbourhood processing may result
            in values being present in area that were originally masked.
        percentiles (float):
            Calculates value at the specified percentiles from the
            neighbourhood surrounding each grid point. This argument has no
            effect if the output is probabilities.
        halo_radius (float):
            Set this radius in metres to define the excess halo to clip. Used
            where a larger grid was defined than the standard grid and we want
            to clip the grid back to the standard grid. Otherwise no clipping
            is applied.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            A processed Cube.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError:
            If weighted_mode is used with the wrong neighbourhood_output.
        RuntimeError:
            If degree_as_complex is used with
            neighbourhood_output='percentiles'.
        RuntimeError:
            If degree_as_complex is used with neighbourhood_shape='circular'.
