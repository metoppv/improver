    """Calculate the maximum value over the height coordinate of a cube. If height bounds are
    specified then the maximum value between these height levels is calculated.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube with a height coordinate.
        lower_height_bound (float):
            The lower bound for the height coordinate. This is either a float or None if no lower
            bound is desired. Any specified bounds should have the same units as the height
            coordinate of cube.
        upper_height_bound (float):
            The upper bound for the height coordinate. This is either a float or None if no upper
            bound is desired. Any specified bounds should have the same units as the height
            coordinate of cube.
        new_name (str):
            The new name to be assigned to the output cube. If unspecified the name of the original
            cube is used.
    Returns:
        A cube of the maximum value over the height coordinate or maximum value between the provided
        height bounds."""
