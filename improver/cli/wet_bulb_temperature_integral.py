    Calculate the wet-bulb temperature integral using the input wet bulb
    temperature data. The integral will be calculated at the height levels on
    which the wet bulb temperatures are provided.

        wet_bulb_temperature (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of wet bulb temperatures on height levels.
