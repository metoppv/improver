    Calibrate a probability forecast using the provided reliability calibration
    table. This calibration is designed to improve the reliability of
    probability forecasts without significantly degrading their resolution. If
    a reliability table is not provided, the input forecast is returned
    unchanged.

    The method implemented here is described in Flowerdew J. 2014. Calibrating
    ensemble reliability whilst preserving spatial structure. Tellus, Ser. A
    Dyn. Meteorol. Oceanogr. 66.

    Args:
        forecast (iris.cube.Cube):
            The forecast to be calibrated.
        reliability_table (iris.cube.Cube or iris.cube.CubeList):
            The reliability calibration table to use in calibrating the
            forecast. If input is a CubeList the CubeList should contain
            separate cubes for each threshold in the forecast cube.
        point_by_point:
            Whether to process each point in the input cube independently.
            Please note this option is memory intensive and is unsuitable
            for gridded input

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Calibrated forecast.
