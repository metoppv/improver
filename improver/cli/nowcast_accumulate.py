    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            The input Cube to be processed.
        advection_velocity (iris.cube.CubeList):
            Advection cubes of U and V.
            These must have the names of either:
            precipitation_advection_x_velocity or grid_eastward_wind
            precipitation_advection_y_velocity or grid_northward_wind
        orographic_enhancement (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing the orographic enhancement fields. May have data
            for multiple times in the cube.
        attributes_config (dict):
            Dictionary containing the required changes to the attributes.
        max_lead_time (int):
            Maximum lead time required (mins).
        lead_time_interval (int):
            Interval between required lead times (mins).
        accumulation_period (int):
            The period over which the accumulation is calculated (mins).
            Only full accumulation periods will be computed. At lead times
            that are shorter than the accumulation period, no accumulation
            output will be produced.
        accumulation_units (str):
            Desired units in which the accumulations should be expressed.
            e.g. 'mm'
