    """
    Manipulate a reliability table to ensure sufficient sample counts in
    as many bins as possible by combining bins with low sample counts.
    Also enforces a monotonic observation frequency.

    Args:
        reliability_table (iris.cube.Cube):
            The reliability table that needs to be manipulated after the
            spatial dimensions have been aggregated.
        minimum_forecast_count (int):
            The minimum number of forecast counts in a forecast probability
            bin for it to be used in calibration.
            The default value of 200 is that used in Flowerdew 2014.
        point_by_point:
            Whether to process each point in the input cube independently.
            Please note this option is memory intensive and is unsuitable
            for gridded input

    Returns:
        iris.cube.CubeList:
            The reliability table that has been manipulated to ensure
            sufficient sample counts in each probability bin and a monotonic
            observation frequency.
            The cubelist contains a separate cube for each threshold in
            the original reliability table.
