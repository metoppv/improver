    """Module to enforce that the sum of data in a list of cubes is equal to the
    corresponding data in a reference cube. Only one of the updated cubes is returned.

    The data are updated as follows, if there are 2 cubes to be normalised containing
    data points a and b respectively with corresponding reference r, then:

    a_new = r * (a / (a + b))
    b_new = r * (b / (a + b))

    which ensures that r = a_new + b_new.

    Args:
        cubes (List of iris.cube.Cube): A list of cubes containing both the cubes to be
            updated and the reference cube. The reference cube will be identified by
            matching the cube name to reference_name.
        reference_name (str): The name of the reference cube, this must match exactly
            one cube in cubes.
        return_name (str): The name of the cube to be returned. this must match exactly
            one cube in cubes.
        ignore_zero_total (bool): Determines whether an error will be raised in the
            instance where the total of non-reference cubes is zero but the
            corresponding value in reference is non-zero. If True this error will not be
            raised - instead the data in the updated cubes will remain as zero values,
            if False an error will be raised.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            The cube in cubes with name matching return_name. The data in the cube will
            have been updated, but the metadata will be identical.
