    """Standardises a cube by one or more of regridding, updating meta-data etc

    Standardise a source cube. Available options are regridding (bi-linear or
    nearest-neighbour, optionally with land-mask awareness), renaming,
    converting units, updating attributes and converting float64 data to
    float32.

    Deprecated behaviour:
    Translates metadata relating to the grid_id attribute from StaGE
    version 1.1.0 to StaGE version 1.2.0. Cubes that have no "grid_id"
    attribute are not recognised as v1.1.0 and are not changed.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Source cube to be standardised
        target_grid (iris.cube.Cube):
            If specified, then regridding of the source against the target
            grid is enabled. If also using land_sea_mask-aware regridding then
            this must be land_binary_mask data.
        land_sea_mask (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube describing the land_binary_mask on the source-grid if
            coastline-aware regridding is required, with land points set to
            one and sea points set to zero.
        regrid_mode (str):
            Selects which regridding techniques to use. Default uses
            iris.analysis.Linear(); "nearest" uses Nearest() (for less
            continuous fields, e.g precipitation); "nearest-with-mask"
            ensures that target data are sources from points with the same
            mask value (for coast-line-dependant variables like temperature).
        extrapolation_mode (str):
            Mode to use for extrapolating data into regions beyond the limits
            of the input cube domain. Refer to online documentation for
            iris.analysis.
            Modes are -
            extrapolate - extrapolated points will take their values from the
            nearest source point
            nan - extrapolated points will be set to NaN
            error - a ValueError will be raised notifying an attempt to
            extrapolate
            mask - extrapolated points will always be masked, even if
            the source data is not a MaskedArray
            nanmask - if the source data is a MaskedArray extrapolated points
            will be masked; otherwise they will be set to NaN
        land_sea_mask_vicinity (float):
            Radius of vicinity to search for a coastline, in metres.
        regridded_title (str):
            New "title" attribute to be set if the field is being regridded
            (since "title" may contain grid information). If None, a default
            value is used.
        attributes_config (dict):
            Dictionary containing required changes that will be applied to
            the attributes.
        coords_to_remove (list):
            List of names of scalar coordinates to remove.
        new_name (str):
            Name of output cube.
        new_units (str):
            Units to convert to.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Processed cube.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If source land_sea_mask is supplied but regrid mode is not
            "nearest-with-mask".
        ValueError:
            If regrid_mode is "nearest-with-mask" but no source land_sea_mask
            is provided (from plugin).
