    Standardise a source cube. Available options are renaming, converting units,
    updating attributes and removing named scalar coordinates. Remaining scalar
    coordinates are collapsed, CellMethod("point": "time") is discarded, and data
    are cast to IMPROVER standard datatypes and units.

    Deprecated behaviour:
    Translates metadata relating to the grid_id attribute from StaGE
    version 1.1.0 to StaGE version 1.2.0. Cubes that have no "grid_id"
    attribute are not recognised as v1.1.0 and are not changed.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Source cube to be standardised
        attributes_config (dict):
            Dictionary containing required changes that will be applied to
            the attributes.
        coords_to_remove (list):
            List of names of scalar coordinates to remove.
        coord_modification (dict):
            A dictionary allowing the direct modification of scalar coordinate
            values in the original units of the coordinate. To be used with
            extreme caution. For example this might be: {"height": 1.5} to set
            the height coordinate to have a value of 1.5m (assuming original
            units of m). Type is inferred, so providing a value of 2 will result
            in an integer type, whilst a value of 2.0 will result in a float
            type (where this is not modified by type enforcement).
        new_name (str):
            Name of output cube.
        new_units (str):
            Units to convert to.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube
