    Standardise a source cube. Available options are renaming, converting units,
    updating attributes and removing named scalar coordinates. Remaining scalar
    coordinates are collapsed, and data are cast to IMPROVER standard datatypes
    and units.

    Deprecated behaviour:
    Translates metadata relating to the grid_id attribute from StaGE
    version 1.1.0 to StaGE version 1.2.0. Cubes that have no "grid_id"
    attribute are not recognised as v1.1.0 and are not changed.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Source cube to be standardised
        attributes_config (dict):
            Dictionary containing required changes that will be applied to
            the attributes.
        coords_to_remove (list):
            List of names of scalar coordinates to remove.
        new_name (str):
            Name of output cube.
        new_units (str):
            Units to convert to.
