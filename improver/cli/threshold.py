    """Module to apply thresholding to a parameter dataset.

    Calculate the threshold truth values of input data relative to the
    provided threshold value. A fuzzy factor or fuzzy bounds may be provided
    to smooth probabilities where values are close to the threshold.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube to be processed.
        threshold_values (list of float):
            Threshold value or values about which to calculate the truth
            values; e.g. 270,300. Must be omitted if 'threshold_config'
            is used.
        threshold_config (dict):
            Threshold configuration containing threshold values and
            (optionally) fuzzy bounds. Best used in combination with
            'threshold_units' It should contain a dictionary of strings that
            can be interpreted as floats with the structure:
            "THRESHOLD_VALUE": [LOWER_BOUND, UPPER_BOUND]
            e.g: {"280.0": [278.0, 282.0], "290.0": [288.0, 292.0]},
            or with structure "THRESHOLD_VALUE": "None" (no fuzzy bounds).
            Repeated thresholds with different bounds are ignored; only the
            last duplicate will be used.
        threshold_units (str):
            Units of the threshold values. If not provided the units are
            assumed to be the same as those of the input cube. Specifying
            the units here will allow a suitable conversion to match
            the input units if possible.
        comparison_operator (str):
            Indicates the comparison_operator to use with the threshold.
            e.g. 'ge' or '>=' to evaluate data >= threshold or '<' to
            evaluate data < threshold. When using fuzzy thresholds, there is
            no difference between < and <= or > and >=.
            Options: > >= < <= gt ge lt le.
        fuzzy_factor (float of None):
            A decimal fraction defining the factor about the threshold value(s)
            which should be treated as fuzzy. Data which fail a test against
            the hard threshold value may return a fractional truth value if
            they fall within this fuzzy factor region.
            Fuzzy factor must be in the range 0-1, with higher values
            indicating a narrower fuzzy factor region / sharper threshold.
            A fuzzy factor cannot be used with a zero threshold or a
            threshold_config file.
        collapse_coord (str):
            An optional ability to set which coordinate we want to collapse
            over. The only supported options are "realization" or "percentile".
            If "percentile" is requested, the percentile coordinate will be
            rebadged as a realization coordinate prior to collapse. The percentile
            coordinate needs to be evenly spaced around the 50th percentile
            to allow successful conversion from percentiles to realizations and
            subsequent collapsing over the realization coordinate.
        vicinity (list of float / int):
            List of distances in metres used to define the vicinities within
            which to search for an occurrence. Each vicinity provided will
            lead to a different gridded field.
        land_sea_mask (Cube):
            Binary land-sea mask data. True for land-points, False for sea.
            Restricts in-vicinity processing to only include points of a
            like mask value.
        fill_masked (float):
            If provided all masked points in cube will be replaced with the
            provided value before thresholding.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Cube of probabilities relative to the given thresholds

    Raises:
        ValueError: If threshold_config and threshold_values are both set
        ValueError: If threshold_config is used for fuzzy thresholding
        ValueError: Cannot apply land-mask cube without in-vicinity processing.
        ValueError: Can only collapse over a realization coordinate or a percentile
            coordinate that has been rebadged as a realization coordinate.
