    """Module to apply thresholding to a parameter dataset.

    Calculate the threshold truth values of input data relative to the
    provided threshold value. A fuzzy factor or fuzzy bounds may be provided
    to smooth probabilities where values are close to the threshold.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube to be processed.
        threshold_values (list of float):
            Threshold value or values about which to calculate the truth
            values; e.g. 270,300. Must be omitted if 'threshold_config'
            is used.
        threshold_config (dict):
            Threshold configuration containing threshold values and
            (optionally) fuzzy bounds. Best used in combination with
            'threshold_units' It should contain a dictionary of strings that
            can be interpreted as floats with the structure:
            "THRESHOLD_VALUE": [LOWER_BOUND, UPPER_BOUND]
            e.g: {"280.0": [278.0, 282.0], "290.0": [288.0, 292.0]},
            or with structure "THRESHOLD_VALUE": "None" (no fuzzy bounds).
            Repeated thresholds with different bounds are ignored; only the
            last duplicate will be used.
        threshold_units (str):
            Units of the threshold values. If not provided the units are
            assumed to be the same as those of the input cube. Specifying
            the units here will allow a suitable conversion to match
            the input units if possible.
        comparison_operator (str):
            Indicates the comparison_operator to use with the threshold.
            e.g. 'ge' or '>=' to evaluate data >= threshold or '<' to
            evaluate data < threshold. When using fuzzy thresholds, there is
            no difference between < and <= or > and >=.
            Options: > >= < <= gt ge lt le.
        fuzzy_factor (float of None):
            A decimal fraction defining the factor about the threshold value(s)
            which should be treated as fuzzy. Data which fail a test against
            the hard threshold value may return a fractional truth value if
            they fall within this fuzzy factor region.
            Fuzzy factor must be in the range 0-1, with higher values
            indicating a narrower fuzzy factor region / sharper threshold.
            A fuzzy factor cannot be used with a zero threshold or a
            threshold_config file.
        collapse_coord (str):
            An optional ability to set which coordinate we want to collapse
            over.
        vicinity (float):
            Distance in metres used to define the vicinity within which to
            search for an occurrence

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Cube of probabilities relative to the given thresholds

    Raises:
        ValueError: If threshold_config and threshold_values are both set
        ValueError: If threshold_config is used for fuzzy thresholding
