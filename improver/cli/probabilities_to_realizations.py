    """Convert probabilities to ensemble realizations using Ensemble Coupla
    Coupling.

    Probabilities are first converted to percentiles, which are then either
    rebadged as realizations or reordered if the raw_cube argument is given.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube to be processed.
        raw_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of raw (not post processed) weather data.
            If this argument is given ensemble realizations will be created
            from percentiles by reshuffling them in correspondance to the rank
            order of the raw ensemble. Otherwise, the percentiles are rebadged
            as realizations.
        realizations_count (int):
            Optional definition of the number of ensemble realizations to
            be generated. These are generated though an intermediate
            percentile representation. Theses percentiles will be
            distributed regularly with the aim of dividing into blocks
            of equal probability. If the raw_cube is given
            and the number of realization is not given the number
            of realizations is taken from the number of realizations
            in the raw_cube.
        random_seed (int):
            Option to specify a value for the random seed for testing
            purposes, otherwise the default random seed behaviours is
            utilised. The random seed is used in the generation of the
            random numbers used for splitting tied values within the raw
            ensemble, so that the values from the input percentiles can
            be ordered to match the raw ensemble.
        ignore_ecc_bounds (bool):
            If True, where percentiles (calculated as an intermediate output
            before realization) exceed to ECC bounds range, raises a warning
            rather than an exception.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Processed result Cube.
