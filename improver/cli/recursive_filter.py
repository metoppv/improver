    """Module to apply a recursive filter to neighbourhooded data.

    Run a recursive filter to convert a square neighbourhood into a
    Gaussian-like kernel or smooth over short distances. The filter uses a
    smoothing_coefficient (between 0 and 1) to control what proportion of the
    probability is passed onto the next grid-square in the x and y directions.
    The smoothing_coefficient can be set on a grid square by grid-square basis
    for the x and y directions separately (using two arrays of
    smoothing_coefficients of the same dimensionality as the domain).

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube to be processed.
        smoothing_coefficients (iris.cube.CubeList):
            CubeList describing the smoothing_coefficients to be used in the x
            and y directions.
        iterations (int):
            Number of times to apply the filter. (Typically < 3)
            Number of iterations should be 2 or less, higher values have been
            shown to lead to poorer conservation.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            The processed Cube.
