    """Calculates the feels like temperature using the data in the input cube.

    Calculate the feels like temperature using a combination of the wind chill
    index and Steadman's apparent temperature equation with the following
    method:

    If temperature < 10 degrees C: The feels like temperature is equal to the
    wind chill.

    If temperature > 20 degrees C: The feels like temperature is equal to the
    apparent temperature.

    If 10 <= temperature <= degrees C: A weighting (alpha) is calculated in
    order to blend between the wind chill and the apparent temperature.

    Args:
        temperature (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of air temperatures at screen level
        wind_speed (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of wind speed at 10m
        relative_humidity (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of relative humidity at screen level
        pressure (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of surface pressure
        model_id_attr (str):
            Name of the attribute used to identify the source model for
            blending.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            Cube of feels like temperature. The units of feels like temperature
            will be the same as the units of temperature cube when it is input
            into the function.
