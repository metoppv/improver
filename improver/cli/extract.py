    """ Extract a subset of a single cube.

    Extracts subset of data from a single cube, subject to equality-based
    constraints.
    Using a set of constraints, extract a sub-cube from the provided cube if it
    is available.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            The Cube from which a sub-cube is extracted
        constraints (list):
            The constraint(s) to be applied. These must be of the form
            "key=value", eg "threshold=1". Multiple constraints can be provided
            by repeating this keyword before each. Scalars, boolean and string
            values are supported. Lists of values can be provided
            e.g. key=[value1, value2, value3]. Alternatively, ranges can also
            be specified e.g. key=[value1:value3].
            When a range is specified, this is inclusive of the endpoints of
            the range.
        units (list):
            List of units as strings corresponding to each coordinate in the
            list of constraints. One or more "units" may be None and units may
            only be associated with coordinate constraints. The list should be
            entered as a comma separated list without spaces, e.g. mm/hr,K.
        ignore_failure (bool):
            Option to ignore constraint match failure and return the input
            cube.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            A single cube matching the input constraints or None. If no
            sub-cube is found within the cube that matches the constraints.
