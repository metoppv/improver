    """Calculate the gradient between adjacent grid squares within
    a cube. The gradient is calculated along the x and y axis
    individually.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube from which the gradients will be calculated.
        regrid (bool):
            If True, the gradient cube is regridded to match the spatial
            dimensions of the input cube. If False, the two output gradient cubes will have
            different spatial coords such that the coord matching the gradient axis will
            represent the midpoint of the input cube and will have one fewer points.
            If the x-axis is marked as circular, the gradient between the last and first points
            is also included.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            iris.cube.Cube:
                Gradients calculated along the x-axis
