    """Generate a timezone mask ancillary.

    Create masks for regions of a geographic grid that are on different
    timezones. The resulting masks can be used to isolate data for specific
    timezones from a grid of the same shape as the cube used in this plugin
    to generate the masks.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube with the desired grid. If no 'time' argument is provided
            to the CLI, the time on this cube will be used for determining the
            validity time of the calculated UTC offsets (this is only relevant
            if daylight savings times are being included).
        include_dst (bool):
            If set, find and use the UTC offset to a grid point including
            daylight savings.
        time (str):
            A datetime specified in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ at which to
            calculate the mask (UTC). If daylight savings are not included
            this will have no impact on the resulting masks.
        groupings (dict):
            A dictionary specifying how timezones should be grouped if so
            desired. This dictionary takes the form::

                {-9: [-12, -6], 0: [-5, 5], 6: [6, 12]}

            The keys indicate the UTC offset that should provide the data for a
            group. The numbers in the lists denote the inclusive limits of the
            timezones for which that data should be used. This is of use if data
            is not available at hourly intervals.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            A cube containing timezone masks for each timezone found in the
            grid within the input cube, grouped into larger areas if so desired.
            Mask values of 1 indicate that a point is masked out, and values of
            0 indicate the point is unmasked.
