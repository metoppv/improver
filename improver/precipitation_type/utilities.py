    """
    Modify the input cube's metadata and coordinates to produce a shower
    condition proxy. The input cube is expected to possess a single valued
    threshold coordinate.

    Args:
        cube:
            A thresholded diagnostic to be used as a proxy for showery conditions.
            The threshold coordinate should contain only one value, which denotes
            the key threshold that above which conditions are showery, and below
            which precipitation is more likely dynamic.
        in_place:
            If set true the cube is modified in place. By default a modified
            copy is returned.

    Returns:
        A shower condition probability cube that is an appropriately renamed
        version of the input with an updated threshold coordinate representing
        the probability of shower conditions occurring.

    Raises:
        CoordinateNotFoundError: Input has no threshold coordinate.
        ValueError: Input cube's threshold coordinate is multi-valued.
