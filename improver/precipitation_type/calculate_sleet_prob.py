    This calculates the probability of sleet using the calculation:
    prob(sleet) = 1 - (prob(snow) + prob(rain))

    Args:
      prob_of_snow:
        Cube of the probability of snow. This can be a fraction (0 <= x <= 1) or
        categorical (0 or 1)
      prob_of_rain:
        Cube of the probability of rain. This can be a fraction (0 <= x <= 1) or

    Returns:
        Cube of the probability of sleet. This will be fractional or categorical,
        matching the highest precision of the inputs.
