    achieve this the codes are subtracted from an arbitrarily larger
    number prior to calculating the mode, and this operation reversed in the
    final output.

    If there are many different codes for a single point over the time
    spanned by the input cubes it may be that the returned mode is not robust.

    a 12 hour period with 12 different codes, one of which is thunder, will

    good representation. In these cases grouping is used to try and select
    a suitable weather code (e.g. a rain shower if the codes include a mix of
    rain showers and dynamic rain) by providing a more robust mode. The lowest

        This approach is taken to accommodate different timezones without the need for
        any timezone awareness. Inputs are always provided from midnight to midnight, or
        ending at midnight if a partial day is provided. The middle of the set of input
        times therefore corresponds to the local middle of the day. The count back
        from the end of the period is done to accommodate partial periods (same day
        updates). The index counted backwards is clipped to 0, meaning if there are
        only 12 files being passed in (because we're around midday when we perform
        the update), the first index will be 0, rather than -6, and only symbols from
        6 periods will be multiplied up by the day_weighting.

        Metadata is not used to select the day period as the times recorded
        within the cubes are all UTC, rather than local time, so the local day period
        can not be identified. The time and forecast_period coordinates are
        incremented by the the minimum arbitrary amount (1 second) to ensure
        non-duplicate coordinates.

            cube: Weather codes cube.

        Returns:
            Cube with more times during the daytime period, so that daytime hours
            are emphasised, depending upon the day_weighting chosen.
