    """Plugin that returns the modal code over the period spanned by the
    input data. In cases of a tie in the mode values, scipy returns the smaller
    value. The opposite is desirable in this case as the significance /
    importance of the weather codes generally increases with the value. To
    achieve this the codes are subtracted from an arbitrarily larger
    number prior to calculating the mode, and this operation reversed in the
    final output.

    If there are many different codes for a single point over the time
    spanned by the input cubes it may be that the returned mode is not robust.
    Given the preference to return more significant codes explained above,
    a 12 hour period with 12 different codes, one of which is thunder, will
    return a thunder code to describe the whole period. This is likely not a
    good representation. In these cases grouping is used to try and select
    a suitable weather code (e.g. a rain shower if the codes include a mix of
    rain showers and dynamic rain) by providing a more robust mode. The lowest
    number (least significant) member of the group is returned as the code.
    Use of the least significant member reflects the lower certainty in the
    forecasts.

    Where there are different weather codes available for night and day, the
    modal code returned is always a day code, regardless of the times
    covered by the input files.
