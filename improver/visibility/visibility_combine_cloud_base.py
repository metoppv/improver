    Combines the probability of visibility relative to a threshold with
    the probability of cloud base at ground level.

    The probability of cloud base at ground level is used as proxy for
    low visibility at a grid square. By combining these diagnostics we
    add additional detail to the visibility diagnostic by capturing
    low cloud over higher areas of orography not resolved in the underlying
    visibility diagnostic.

    The probability of cloud base at ground level is multiplied by a scalar
    before combining. The scalar is dependent on which visibility threshold
    it is combined with. This is done to produce variation across the final
    visibility thresholds following combining.

    The maximum probability is then taken of the scaled cloud base at ground
    level and the visibility forecast. This is used as the outputted visibility
    forecast.
