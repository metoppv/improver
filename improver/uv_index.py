    A plugin to calculate the uv index using radiation flux in UV downward
    at surface, radiation flux UV upward at surface and a scaling factor.
    The scaling factor is configurable by the user.

    Args:
        uv_upward:
            A cube of the radiation flux in UV upward at surface. This is a
            UM diagnostic produced by the UM radiation scheme.
            This band covers 200-320 nm and uses six absorption coefficients
            for ozone and one Rayleigh scattering coefficient(W m-2)
        uv_downward:
            A cube of the radiation flux in UV downward at surface.
            This is a UM diagnostic produced by the UM radiation scheme
            see above or the paper referenced for more details.(W m-2)
        scale_factor:
            The uv scale factor. Default is 3.6. This factor has
            been empirically derived and should not be
            changed except if there are scientific reasons to
            do so. For more information see section 2.1.1 of the paper
            referenced below (no units)
        model_id_attr:
            Name of the attribute used to identify the source model for
            blending.

    Returns:
        A cube of the calculated UV index.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If uv_upward is not named correctly.
        ValueError: If uv_downward is not named correctly.
        ValueError: If units do not match.
