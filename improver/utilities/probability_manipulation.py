    The threshold inequality is limited to being above (above=True) or below

    "greater_than_or_equal_to". It is not possible to flip probabilities from
    e.g. "less_than_or_equal_to" to "greater_than_or_equal_to", only to
    "greater_than". As such the operation will use the valid inversion that
    achieves the broader target inequality.
