class OrographicSmoothingCoefficients(BasePlugin):

    """
    Class to generate smoothing coefficients for recursive filtering based on
    orography gradients.

    A smoothing coefficient determines how much "value" of a cell
    undergoing filtering is comprised of the current value at that cell and
    how much comes from the adjacent cell preceding it in the direction in
    which filtering is being applied. A larger smoothing_coefficient results in
    a more significant proportion of a cell's new value coming from its
    neighbouring cell.

    The smoothing coefficients are calculated from the orography gradient using
    a simple equation and the user defined values for coefficient and power:

    .. math::
        \\rm{smoothing\\_coefficient} = \\rm{coefficient} \\times
        \\rm{gradient}^{\\rm{power}}

    The resulting values are scaled between min_gradient_smoothing_coefficient and
    max_gradient_smoothing_coefficient to give the desired range of
    smoothing_coefficients. These limiting values must be greater than or equal to
    zero and less than or equal to 0.5.

    Note that the smoothing coefficients are returned on a grid that is one cell
    smaller in the given dimension than the input orography, i.e. the smoothing
    coefficients in the x-direction are returned on a grid that is one cell
    smaller in x than the input. This is because the coefficients are used in
    both forward and backward passes of the recursive filter, so they need to be
    symmetric between cells in the original grid to help ensure conservation.
