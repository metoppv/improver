def choose(index_array: ndarray, array_set: ndarray) -> ndarray:
    """
    Create a reordered copy of a data array, where an index array of matching
    shape determines how the data is reordered.

    The reordered copy of the array will have the same shape as the inputs.
    If a 3-dimensional array_set is provided, the data coordinates could be
    described as A[i, j, k]. This function does not rearrange the j and k
    coordinates. The reordered array is constructed by substituting into each
    position [i, j, k] in the index_array a value taken from the array_set
    at a matching [j, k] position, but where [i] is determined by the given
    index value. As such the index values must run 0 - N-1 where N is the
    length of the leading dimension of array_set (and equivalently of
    index_array).

    The following figure gives an examples of the expected result of this
    function for a given index_array and array_set.

       The input data array is reordered along the leading dimension (i),
       but maintains its sub-array position (j, k), denoted here by the
       different colours.

    Args:
        index_array:
            This array must contain integers in the range [0, N-1], where N is
            if the length of the leading dimension of the array_set array.
            These integers determine how array_set will be reordered in the
            returned array.
        array_set:
            A multi-dimensional array, where the leading dimension is in effect
            an indexing dimension. Within this leading dimension are the
            sub-arrays from which values are to be extracted at positions that
            match those given in the index_array.

    Returns:
        An array containing the reordered data extracted from array_set.
        The returned array will have the same shape as the index_array and
        array_set arrays.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If index_array and array_set do not have matching shapes.
        IndexError: If an index exceeds the length of the leading dimension
                    of the array_set array (N-1).
