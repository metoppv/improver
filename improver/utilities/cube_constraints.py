) -> Constraint:
    """
    Create a lambda constraint for a range. This formulation of specifying
    a lambda constraint has the benefit of not needing to hardcode the name
    for the coordinate, so that this can be determined at runtime.

    The created function uses float values. As a result, a small tolerance is
    used to spread the ends of the ranges to help with float equality
    matching. Note that the relative tolerance will not affect values of zero.
    Adding/subtracting an absolute tolerance is not done due to the
    difficulty of selecting an appropriate value given the very small values
    of precipitation rates expressed in m s-1.

    Args:
        coord_name:
            Name of the coordinate.
        values:
            A list of two values that represent the inclusive end points
            of a range.
        tolerance:
            A relative tolerance value to ensure equivalence matching when
            using float32 values. Values of zero will be unchanged.

    Returns:
        Constraint representative of a range of values.
