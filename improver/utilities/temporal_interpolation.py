class TemporalInterpolation(BasePlugin):
    """
    Interpolate data to intermediate times between the validity times of two
    cubes. This can be used to fill in missing data (e.g. for radar fields) or
    to ensure data is available at the required intervals when model data is
    not available at these times.

    The plugin will return the interpolated times and the later of the two
    input times. This allows us to modify the input diagnostics if they
    represent accumulations.

    The IMPROVER convention is that period diagnostics have their time
    coordinate point at the end of the period. The later of the two inputs
    therefore covers the period that has been broken down into shorter periods
    by the interpolation and, if working with accumulations, must itself be
    modified. The result of this approach is that in a long run of
    lead-times, e.g. T+0 to T+120 all the lead-times will be available except
    T+0.

    If working with period maximums and minimums we cannot return values in
    the new periods that do not adhere to the inputs. For example, we might
    have a 3-hour maximum of 5 ms-1 between 03-06Z. The period before it might
    have a maximum of 11 ms-1. Upon splitting the 3-hour period into 1-hour
    periods the gradient might give us the following results:

    Inputs: 00-03Z: 11 ms-1, 03-06Z: 5 ms-1
    Outputs: 03-04Z: 9 ms-1, 04-05Z: 7 ms-1, 05-06Z: 5ms-1

    However these outputs are not in agreement with the original 3-hour period
    maximum of 5 ms-1 over the period 03-06Z. We enforce the maximum from the
    original period which results in:

    Inputs: 00-03Z: 10 ms-1, 03-06Z: 5 ms-1
    Outputs: 03-04Z: 5 ms-1, 04-05Z: 5 ms-1, 05-06Z: 5ms-1

    If instead the preceding period maximum was 2 ms-1 we would use the trend
    to produce lower maximums in the interpolated 1-hour periods, becoming:

    Inputs: 00-03Z: 2 ms-1, 03-06Z: 5 ms-1
    Outputs: 03-04Z: 3 ms-1, 04-05Z: 4 ms-1, 05-06Z: 5ms-1

    This interpretation of the gradient information is retained in the output
    as it is consistent with the original period maximum of 5 ms-1 between
    03-06Z. As such we can impart increasing trends into maximums over periods
    but not decreasing trends. The counter argument can be made when
    interpolating minimums in periods, allowing us only to introduce
    decreasing trends for these.

    We could use the cell methods to determine whether we are working with
    accumulations, maximums, or minimums. This should be denoted as a cell
    method associated with the time coordinate, e.g. for an accumulation it
    would be `time: sum`, whilst a maximum would have `time: max`. However
    we cannot guarantee these cell methods are present. As such the
    interpolation of periods here relies on the user supplying a suitable
    keyword argument that denotes the type of period being processed.

    shorter periods, optionally applying a night mask to ensure that
    quantities defined only in the day or night are not spread into
    night or day periods respectively.

    This is a very simple approach. In the case of sunshine duration
    the duration is divided up evenly across the short periods defined
    by the fidelity argument. These are then optionally masked to zero
    for chosen periods (day or night). Values in the non-zeroed periods
    are then renormalised relative to the original period total, such
    that the total across the whole period ought to equal the original. This
    is not always possible as the night mask applied is simpler than e.g. the
    radiation scheme impact on a 3D orography. As such the renormalisation
    could yield durations longer than the fidelity period in each
    non-zeroed period as it tries to allocate e.g. 5 hours of sunlight
    across 4 non-zeroed hours. This is not physical, so the renormalisation
    is partnered with a clip that limits the duration allocated to the
    renormalised periods to not exceed their length. The result of this
    is that the original sunshine durations cannot be recovered for points
    that are affected. Instead the calculated night mask is limiting the
    accuracy to allow the subdivision to occur. This is the cost of this
    method.

    Note that this method cannot account for any weather impacts e.g. cloud
    that is affecting the sunshine duration in a period. If a 6-hour period is
    split into three 2-hour periods the split will be even regardless of
    when thick cloud might occur.
