    Args:
        data (numpy.ndarray):
            The field of data to be interpolated across gaps.
        method (str):
            The method to use to fill in the data. This is usually "linear" for
            linear interpolation, and "nearest" for a nearest neighbour
            approach. It can take any method available to the method
            scipy.interpolate.griddata.
        limit (numpy.ndarray):
            The array containing upper limits for each grid point that are
            imposed on any value in the region that has been interpolated.
        valid_points (numpy.ndarray):
            A boolean array that allows a subset of the unmasked data to be
            chosen as source data for the interpolation process. True values
            in this array mark points that can be used for interpolation if
            they are not otherwise invalid. False values mark points that
            should not be used, even if they are otherwise valid data points.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray:
            The original data plus interpolated data in holes where it was
            possible to fill these in.
