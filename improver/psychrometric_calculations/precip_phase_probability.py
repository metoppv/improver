class PrecipPhaseProbability(BasePlugin):
    """
    This plugin converts a falling-phase-change-level cube into the
    probability of a specific precipitation phase being found at the surface.

    Consider the case in which a snow-falling-level diagnostic is given as
    input. For a deterministic snow-falling-level diagnostic (i.e. no percentile
    coordinate), these falling levels are compared directly to the altitudes
    of interest to determine the binary probability (0 or 1) of snow at these
    altitudes. A 0 is returned if the altitude is below the snow-falling-level
    and a 1 if the altitude if above the snow-falling-level. If a probabilistic
    snow-falling-level is provided, this plugin will seek to use the 80th
    percentile falling-level to compare with the altitudes. This provides a
    greater level of certainty that the phase is snow, and in conjunction with
    the percentile chosen for rain (see below), provides for a greater depth
    of sleet (mixed phase precipitation).

    The plugin behaves in the same way for a rain-falling-level, but in the
    case of a probabalistic input, the 20th percentile is used. This lowers
    the falling-level within the atmosphere, providing for greater certainty
    that the phase is entirely rain.

    The altitudes used in these comparisons may be provided as gridded
    orographies or as spot forecast ancillaries that contain an altitude
    coordinate. In the former case the phase probability will be determined at
    each grid point at the orographic altitude. In the latter case, the phase
    probability will be determined at each site's specific altitude.

        Converts units of falling_level_cube to that of orography_cube / site
