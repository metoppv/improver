class HailSize(BasePlugin):
    """Plugin to calculate the diameter of the hail stones from input cubes
    cloud condensation level (ccl) temperature, cloud condensation level pressure,
    temperature on pressure levels, the height of the wet bulb freezing level
    above sea level and orography.

    From these, the values for three other cubes are calculated:
        - Temperature of the environment at 268.15K (-5 Celsius) and the
          pressure level where this occurs.
        - Temperature after a saturated ascent from ccl pressure to the
          pressure of the environment at 268.15K (-5 Celsius).
        - Temperature after a dry adiabatic descent from the pressure of the
          environment at 268.15K (-5 Celsius) to the ccl pressure.

    From these, two indexes are calculated as:
        - Temperature after a dry adiabatic descent - the temperature of the
          atmosphere at 268.15K
        - Temperature after a saturated ascent - the temperature of the
          atmosphere at 268.15K

    These indexes can then be used to extract values of hail size depending on
    the wet bulb freezing altitude. The wet bulb freezing altitude is calculated
    by subtracting the orography from the wet bulb freezing altitude above sea level.

    If the wet bulb freezing altitude is between 3350m and 4400m then the indexes are used
    to extract an initial hail value from the first table. A second table
    is then accessed to reduce the hail size. The second table is stored as a dictionary, with the
    key being the wet bulb freezing altitude and each column in the associated
    arrays referring to the previously calculated hail diameter being less than a pre-defined
    value. An updated hail_size is then extracted and stored.

    If the wet_bulb_freezing_altitude is greater than 4400m then the hail size is set to
    0 and if the wet bulb_freezing_altitude is less than 3350m then the originally calculated
    hail size is not altered.

    Both tables are taken from Hand and Cappelluti (2011) which are a tabular versions of the
    graphs from Fawbush and Miller(1953)
