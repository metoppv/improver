    Class to adjust spot extracted "height above ground level" forecasts to account
    for differences between site height and orography grid square height. The spot
    forecast contains information representative of the associated grid point and as
    such this needs to be adjusted to reflect the true site altitude.

    For realization or percentile data the vertical displacement is added on to
    each realization or percentile.

    For probability data the data is interpolated between thresholds for each site and
    the equivalent set of thresholds relative to the site altitude extracted. Any
    new threshold that is above or below the original set of thresholds uses the highest
    or lowest threshold's probability from the original cube respectively for that spot.
