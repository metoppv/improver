        Args:
            apply_lapse_rate_correction (bool):
                Use to apply a lapse-rate correction to screen temperature
                forecasts so that they better represent the altitude of the
                spot site for which they have been extracted. This lapse rate
                will be applied for a fixed orographic difference between the
                site and grid point altitude. Differences in orography in
                excess of this fixed limit will use the Environmental Lapse
                Rate (also known as the Standard Atmosphere Lapse Rate).
            fixed_lapse_rate (float):
                If provided, use this fixed value as a lapse-rate for adjusting
                the forecast values if apply_lapse_rate_correction is True. This
                can be used instead of providing a lapse rate cube. Value is
                given in Kelvin / metre of temperature change with ascent. For
                example a dry adiabatic lapse rate would be given as -0.0098.
                This lapse rate will be applied for a fixed orographic difference
                between the site and gridpoint altitude. Differences in orography
                in excess of this fixed limit will use the Environmental Lapse
                Rate (also known as the Standard Atmosphere Lapse Rate).
            land_constraint (bool):
                Use to select the nearest-with-land-constraint neighbour-selection
                method from the neighbour_cube. This means that the grid points
                should be land points except for sites where none were found within
                the search radius when the neighbour cube was created. May be used
                with similar_altitude.
            similar_altitude (bool):
                Use to select the nearest-with-height-constraint
                neighbour-selection method from the neighbour_cube. These are grid
                points that were found to be the closest in altitude to the spot
                site within the search radius defined when the neighbour cube was
                created. May be used with land_constraint.
            extract_percentiles (list or int):
                If set to a percentile value or a list of percentile values,
                data corresponding to those percentiles will be returned. For
                example "25, 50, 75" will result in the 25th, 50th and 75th
                percentiles being returned from a cube of probabilities,
                percentiles or realizations. Deterministic input data will raise
                a warning message.
                Note that for percentile inputs, if the desired percentile(s) do
                not exist in the input cube the available percentiles will be
                resampled to produce those requested.
            ignore_ecc_bounds_exceedance (bool):
                Demotes exceptions where calculated percentiles are outside the ECC
                bounds range to warnings.
            skip_ecc_bounds (bool):
                If True, ECC bounds are not included when probabilities
                are converted to percentiles. This has the effect that percentiles
                outside of the range given by the input percentiles will be computed
                by nearest neighbour interpolation from the nearest available percentile,
                rather than using linear interpolation between the nearest available
                percentile and the ECC bound.
            new_title (str):
                New title for the spot-extracted data.  If None, this attribute is
                removed from the output cube since it has no prescribed standard
                and may therefore contain grid information that is no longer
                correct after spot-extraction.
            suppress_warnings (bool):
                Suppress warning output. This option should only be used if it
                is known that warnings will be generated but they are not required.
            realization_collapse (bool):
                Triggers equal-weighting blending of the realization coord if required.
                Use this if a threshold coord is also present on the input cube.
