    Parse radii and lead_times provided to CLIs that use neighbourhooding.
    If no lead times are provided, return the first radius for use at all
    lead times. If lead times are provided, ensure there are sufficient
    radii to assign one to each lead time. If so return two lists, else raise
    an exception.

            Radii as a list provided by clize.

    Returns:
        - Radii as a float or list of floats.
        - Lead times in hours as a list of ints or None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If multiple radii are provided without any lead times.
