class ApplyNeighbourhoodProcessingWithAMask(PostProcessingPlugin):

    r"""Class for applying neighbourhood processing when passing in a mask
    cube that is iterated over.

    Example:

        This plugin is designed to work with a set of masks which help you
        select points which are similar and only use these in your
        neighbourhood. The most obvious example of this is to divide the
        points in your cube into bands of similar orographic height.
        ::

            ..............................
            Band 2        ---
            ............./...\.../\.......
            Band 1      /     ---  \
            .........../............\.....
            Band 0    /              --
            ........--.................\..

        In this case the mask cube that comes in has a "topographic_zone"
        coordinate and each slice along this dimension has a 2D mask,
        masking out any points which are outside the topographic band that is
        described by the "topographic_zone" coordinate.

        The result from this plugin is a cube which has applied
        neighbourhooding to the plugin *n* times for the *n* bands in the mask
        cube. Each topography mask has been applied to the input cube in turn,
        resulting in a cube with a "topographic_zone" coordinate which is
        returned from this plugin.

        The re_mask option can be used to return the resulting cube with a
        "topographic_zone" coordinate, with each slice over the
        "topographic_zone" masked using the input mask cube.

        Otherwise if weights are provided then you can weight between
        adjacent bands when you collapse the new "topographic_zone" coordinate.
        This takes into account the result from the neighbourhood processing to
        adjust the weights for points in a "topographic_zone" that don't have
        a valid result.

        For example below we have two points A and B. Say point A was halfway
        between the midpoint and top of the lower band. We would want to
        generate a final result by weighting 0.75 times to neighbourhooded
        value from the bottom band and 0.25 times the neighbourhooded value in
        the upper band. For point B we would take equal weightings between the
        bands. There is a plugin to generate these weights:
        :class:`~improver.generate_ancillaries.\
        generate_topographic_zone_weights.GenerateTopographicZoneWeights`
        ::

                        A             B
                    ..........................
            band 2

                    ..................x.......
                        x
            band 1
                    ..........................

        We may need to adjust the weights if there is missing data in the
        adjacent band. If we look at the diagram with labelled bands, points
        that are near the top of band 2 could be weighted with band 3, except
        there are no nearby points in band 3. In this case the neighbourhood
        code puts NaNs in band 3 and we want to take 100% of band 2. This can
        be easily done by renormalization of the weights, which happens
        automatically within the numpy functions called within the
        iris collapse method.

        After collapsing the "topographic_zone" coordinate we end up with a
        cube with the same dimensions as the original cube, but the neighbourhood
        processing has been applied using masks so that only similar points
        are used in the neighbourhood.

        See also :class:`~improver.generate_ancillaries.generate_ancillary.\
        GenerateOrographyBandAncils`
        for a plugin for generating topographic band masks.

                weights resulting in an output cube with the same dimensions
                as the input cube. Otherwise the output cube will have the
                coord_for_masking from the supplied mask_cube as an additional
                dimension. The data in this cube may be an instance of
                numpy.ma.masked_array, for example if sea points have been
                set to np.nan and masked in order for them to be discounted
                when calculating the result. In this case the result returned
                from the process method of this plugin will have the same
                points masked.
            lead_times:
                List of lead times or forecast periods, at which the radii
                within 'radii' are defined. The lead times are expected
                in hours.

                If False, use a circle with constant weighting.

                Identifier for whether sum or fraction should be returned from
                neighbourhooding. The sum represents the sum of the
                neighbourhood.
                The fraction represents the sum of the neighbourhood divided by
                the neighbourhood area. "fraction" is the default.

                If re_mask is False, the original un-neighbourhood processed
                mask is not applied. Therefore, the neighbourhood processing
                may result in values being present in areas that were
                originally masked.
