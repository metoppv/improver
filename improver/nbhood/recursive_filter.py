        The smoothing_coefficient determines how much "value" of a cell

        how much comes from the adjacent cell preceding it in the direction in
        which filtering is being applied. A larger smoothing_coefficient
        results in a more significant proportion of a cell's new value coming
        from its neighbouring cell.
