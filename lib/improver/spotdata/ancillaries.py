    """
    Takes in a list of desired diagnostics and determines which ancillary
    (i.e. non-time dependent) fields are required given their neighbour
    finding or data extraction methods.

    Args:
        diagnostics (dict):
            Dictionary containing each diagnostic to be processed with
            associated options for how they should be produced, e.g. method of
            neighbour selection, method of data extraction etc.

        ancillary_path (string):
            String giving the path of ancillary files to be used.

    Returns:
        ancillary_data (dict):
            Dictionary containing named ancillary data; the key gives the name
            and the item is the iris.cube.Cube of data.

    Raises:
        IOError if required input files are not found.
