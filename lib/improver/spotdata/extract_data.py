            of S.B. Vosper 2005 - Near-surface temperature variations over
            complex terrain; Milestone Report RC10JR Local forecasting in
            complex terrain; V 1.0 August 2005.

            Calculate potential temperature gradient and use this to adjust

            depending on whether the adjustment is an extrapolation to below
            the lowest available model level, or an interpolation between
            available levels.

            The essential equations are those converting between temperature
            and potential temperature (theta)::

                           pref   R/cp                 p_site  R/cp

              ln (Theta) = ln (T)     + kappa [ ln(pref) - ln(p) ]
              ln (T)     = ln (Theta) + kappa [ ln(p) - ln(pref) ]

              kappa = (R_DRY_AIR / CP_DRY_AIR)
              pref = 1000 hPa (1.0E5 Pa)
              p_site = pressure interpolated/extrapolated to spotdata site
                       assuming a linear change in pressure with altitude; this
                       is assumption is reasonable if dz_max_adjustment is not
                       large (> several hundred metres).


            **Methodology**

            Use multi-level temperature data to calculate potential temperature
            gradients and use these to adjust extracted grid point temperatures
            to the altitudes of SpotData sites::


              ---upper_level--- Model level (k_upper)

              ---lower_level--- Model level (k_lower)

              --model_surface-- Model level (k=0)


            1. Calculate potential temperature gradient between lower and
               upper model levels.
            2. Compare the gradient with a defined threshold value that is
               used to indicate whether the gradient has been calculated
               across an inversion::

                 dtheta/dz <= threshold --> Keep value
                 dtheta/dz >  threshold --> Recalculate gradient between
                                            surface and lower_level to capture
                                            inversion.

            3. Determine if the SpotData site is below the lowest model level
               (the surface level, dz < 0). (This check is only at the
               neighbouring grid point, so doesn't actually guarantee we are
               below the model orography; combining this with neighbour finding
               with a below bias can ensure we are finding unresolved valleys/
               dips).


               **IF SpotData site height < model_surface --> Extrapolate
               downwards.**

               True surface below model surface (dz -ve) `Unresolved valley`::

                 ---upper_level--- Model level (k_upper)

                 ---lower_level--- Model level (k_lower)

                 --model_surface-- Model level (k=0)

                 ===site height=== SpotData site height

               4. Calculate pressure gradient between lower and upper model
                  levels.
               5. Use calculated gradients to extrapolate potential temperature
                  and pressure to the SpotData site height.
               6. Convert back to temperature using the equations given above.
               7. RETURN RESULT.

               **ELSE: SpotData site height > model_surface --> Interpolate to
               site height.**

               True surface above model surface (dz +ve) 'Unresolved hill'::

                 ---upper_level--- Model level (k_upper)

                 ===site height=== SpotData site height

                 ---lower_level--- Model level (k_lower)

                 --model_surface-- Model level (k=0)


               4. Use potential temperature gradient as an indicator of
                  atmospheric stability.

                  **IF: dtheta/dz > 0 --> Stable atmosphere**

                  5. Calculate pressure gradient between lower and upper model
                     levels.
                  6. Use calculated gradients to extrapolate potential
                     temperature and pressure to the SpotData site height.
                  7. Convert back to temperature using the equations given
                     above.
                  8. RETURN RESULT.

                  **ELSE: dtheta/dz <= 0 --> Neutral/well-mixed atmosphere**

                  5. Use potential temperature from surface level; for a well
                     mixed atmosphere dtheta/dz should be nearly constant.
                  6. Convert back to temperature using the pressure
                     interpolated to SpotData site height.
                  7. RETURN RESULT.
