            orography (iris.cube.Cube):
                A cube of orography, used to obtain the grid point altitudes.
            land_mask (iris.cube.Cube):
                A land mask cube for the model/grid from which grid point
                neighbours are being selected.

            iris.cube.Cube:

                the grid point indices of its nearest neighbour as per the
                imposed constraints.
