    '''
    Tests for the minimum_height_error neighbour method of point selection.
    This method seeks to minimise the vertical displacement between a spotdata
    site and a neigbouring grid point.

    In this case there is a bias towards dz being negative (grid point ABOVE
    site), but if this condition cannot be met, a minimum positive dz (grid
    point below site) neighbour will be returned.

    A neighbouring grid point is REQUIRED to be a land point if the site's
    first guess nearest neigbour is a land point. If the first guess neighbour
    is a sea point, the site is assumed to be a sea point as well and the
    neighbour point will not be changed.
