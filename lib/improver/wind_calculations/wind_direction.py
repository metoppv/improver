class WindDirection(object):
    """Plugin to calculate average wind direction from ensemble realizations.

    Science background:
    Taking an average wind direction is tricky since an average of two wind
    directions at 10 and 350 degrees is 180 when it should be 0 degrees.
    Converting the wind direction angles to complex numbers allows us to
    find a useful numerical average. ::

        z = a + bi
        a = r*Cos(theta)
        b = r*Sin(theta)
        r = radius

    The average of two complex numbers is NOT the ANGLE between two points
    it is the MIDPOINT in cartesian space.
    Therefore if there are two data points with radius=1 at 90 and 270 degrees
    then the midpoint is at (0,0) with radius=0 and therefore its average angle
    is meaningless. ::

                   N
                   |
        W---x------o------x---E
                   |
                   S

    In the rare case that a meaningless complex average is calculated, the
    code rejects the calculated complex average and simply uses the wind
    direction taken from the first ensemble realization.

    The steps are:

    1) Take data from all ensemble realizations.
    2) Convert the wind direction angles to complex numbers.
    3) Find complex average and their radius values.
    4) Convert the complex average back into degrees.
    5) If any point has an radius of nearly zero - replace the
       calculated average with the wind direction from the first ensemble.
    6) Calculate the confidence measure of the wind direction.

    Step 6 still needs more development so it is only included in the code
    as a placeholder.
