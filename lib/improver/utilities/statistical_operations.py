class ProbabilitiesFromPercentiles2D(object):
    r"""
    Generate a 2-dimensional field of probabilities by interpolating a
    percentiled cube of data to required points.

    Examples:

        Given a reference field of values against a percentile coordinate, an
        interpolation is performed using another field of values of the same
        type (e.g. height). This returns the percentile with which these
        heights would be associated in the reference field. This effectively
        uses the field of values as a 2-dimensional set of thresholds, and the
        percentiles looked up correspond to the probabilities of these
        thresholds being reached.

        Snow-fall level::

            Reference field: Percentiled snow fall level (m ASL)
            Other field: Orography (m ASL)

            300m ----------------- 30th Percentile snow fall level
            200m ----_------------ 20th Percentile snow fall level
            100m ---/-\----------- 10th Percentile snow fall level
            000m --/---\----------  0th Percentile snow fall level
            ______/     \_________ Orogaphy

        The orography heights are compared against the heights that
        correspond with percentile values to find the band in which they
        fall; this diagram hides the 2-dimensional variability of the snow
        fall level. The percentile values are then interpolated to the
        height of the point being considered. This constructs a
        2-dimensional field of probabilities that snow will be falling at
        each point in the orography field.

        Using a percentiles_cube containing a distinct percentile distribution
        for each point on a 2-dimensional grid, we can interpolate through each
        distribution to obtain a probability. The point to which we interpolate
        is defined by the threshold_cube.
        Note that the current implementation assumes that in cases of a
        degenerate percentile distribution, the right most bin in which a
        threshold value is found is chosen.

        e.g.
        ::

            Percentile: 0 10 20 30 40 50 ...
            Height (m): 0 0 0 15 30 40 ...

        A height of 0m will be associated with a probabilty of 20%. This is
        not correct, but nor is the approach of taking 0%. The percentile
        approach is not suitable with these degenerate distributions, so be
        wary of the returned probabilities.

        Examples:
            This simple linear interpolator works in the following way.

            percentiles_cube::

                [ [[2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
                   [2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
                   [2.0, 2.0, 2.0]],

                  [[4.0, 4.0, 4.0],
                   [4.0, 4.0, 4.0],
                   [4.0, 4.0, 4.0]] ]

            threshold_cube::

                [ [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
                  [3.0, 3.0, 3.0],
                  [5.0, 5.0, 5.0] ]

            value_bounds::

                [ [[np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                   [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                   [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan]],

                  [[np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                   [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                   [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan]] ]

            percentile_bounds::

                [ [[-1, -1, -1],
                   [-1, -1, -1],
                   [-1, -1, -1]],

                  [[-1, -1, -1],
                   [-1, -1, -1],
                   [-1, -1, -1]] ]

            1. Create slices over each percentile, and using the correct
               inequality (as determined by inverse_ordering) compare the
               threshold values to the percentiles slice; here we assume
               inverse_ordering is False, so we use >=. We then populate the
               value_bounds and percentile_bounds arrays.

               Slice 0 - 0th Percentile::

                   [[1.0 >= 2.0, 1.0 >= 2.0, 1.0 >= 2.0],
                    [3.0 >= 2.0, 3.0 >= 2.0, 3.0 >= 2.0],
                    [5.0 >= 2.0, 5.0 >= 2.0, 5.0 >= 2.0]]

                   [[False, False, False],
                    [True, True, True],
                    [True, True, True]]

               The value_bounds array has a leading dimensions with 2 indices
               to be associated with the lower [0] and upper bounds [1] about
               the threshold being considered. The [0] index is populated with
               the values in the slice of percentiles_cube at every True index.
               The [1] index is populated with the values in the next slice of
               percentiles_cube.
               ::

                   [ [[np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                      [2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
                      [2.0, 2.0, 2.0]],

                     [[np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                      [4.0, 4.0, 4.0],
                      [4.0, 4.0, 4.0]] ]

               The percentile_bounds array is also contains a leading dimension
               associated with lower and upper bounds about the thresholds. The
               lower bound array is populated at every True index with the
               current percentile value (0 in this first slice), whilst the
               upper bound array takes the percentile value from the next
               slice.
               ::

                   [ [[-1, -1, -1],
                      [0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0]],

                     [[-1, -1, -1],
                      [50, 50, 50],
                      [50, 50, 50]] ]

               After the same process is applied to the next slice, the 50th
               percentile, we end up with value_bounds::

                   [ [[np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                      [2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
                      [4.0, 4.0, 4.0]],

                     [[np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
                      [4.0, 4.0, 4.0],
                      [4.0, 4.0, 4.0]] ]

               And percentile bounds::

                   [ [[-1, -1, -1],
                      [0, 0, 0],
                      [50, 50, 50]],

                     [[-1, -1, -1],
                      [50, 50, 50],
                      [50, 50, 50]] ]

               Note that where there is no availble +1 index in the
               percentiles_cube the upper bound is set to be the same as the
               lower_bound.

            2. When all slices have been interated over, the interpolants are
               calculated using the threshold values and the values_bounds.
               ::

                   (threshold_cube.data - lower_bound) /
                   (upper_bound - lower_bound)

               If the upper_bound and lower_bound are the same this leads to
               a divide by 0 calculation, resulting in np.inf as the output.

            3. The interpolants are used to calculate the percentile value at
               each point in the array using the percentile_bounds.
               ::

                   lower_percentile_bound + interpolants *
                   (upper_percentile_bounds - lower_percentile_bounds)

               The percentiles are divided by 100 to give a fractional
               probability.

            5. Any probabilities that are calculated to be np.inf indicate that
               the associated point has a threshold value that is above
               the top percentile band. These points are given a probability
               value of 1.

            4. Any points for which the calculated probability is np.nan had
               threshold values that were never found to fall within a
               percentile band, and so must be below the lowest band. These
               points are given a probability value of 0.

            threshold_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
