    """
    Rescale data array so that data_min => scale_min
    and data_max => scale max.
    All adjustments are linear

    Args:
        data (numpy.ndarray):
            Source values

    Keyword Args:
        data_range (list):
            List containing two floats
            Lowest and highest source value to rescale.
            Default value of None is converted to [min(data), max(data)]
        scale_range (list):
            List containing two floats
            Lowest and highest value after rescaling.
            Defaults to (0., 1.)
        clip (boolean):
            If True, points where data were outside the scaling range
            will be set to the scale min or max appropriately.
            Default is False which continues the scaling beyond min and
            max.

    Returns:
        result (numpy.ndarray):
            Output array of scaled data. Has same shape as data.
