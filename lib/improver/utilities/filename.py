def generate_file_name(cube, parameter=None, include_period=False):
    """
    From a forecast cube, generate an IMPROVER-suitable file name using the
    correct lead time. Based on existing StaGE functionality. Requires a
    "time" coordinate. If the cube has no "forecast_period" coordinate (for
    example if the input is a radar composite or other observation), this
    function creates a dummy string representing a forecast period of zero.

    The filename generated will be of the format:
    20180806T2300Z-PT0012H00M-lwe_precip_rate.nc.
    If a period is included, the filename will become:
    20180806T2300Z-PT0012H00M-lwe_precip_accumulation-PT03H.nc

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing nowcast data
        parameter (str):
            Optional parameter name to use in the output filename rather than
            taking the name of the cube diagnostic.
        include_period (bool):
            Optional argument to indicate whether a period, accumulation or
            time window identifier should be included within the filename.

    Returns:
        str:
            File base name to which to write

    Raises:
        ValueError: In order to calculate the period, either the
            forecast_period or the time coordinate must have bounds.
        ValueError: The period deduced by the coordinate bounds must be either
            less than 1 hour or in terms of whole hours.
