    From a forecast cube, generate an IMPROVER-suitable file name using the
    correct lead time.  Based on existing StaGE functionality.  Requires a
    "time" coordinate.  If the cube has no "forecast_period" coordinate (for
    example if the input is a radar composite or other observation), this
    function creates a dummy string representing a forecast period of zero.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing nowcast data

    Returns:
        filename (str):
            File base name to which to write
