    """
    Plugin for adjusting weights spatially based on missing data in the input
    cube. It takes in an initial one dimensional cube of weights which would
    be used to collapse a dimension on the input cube and outputs weights
    which have been adjusted based on the presence of missing data in x-y
    slices of input data. The resulting weights cube has a x and y dimensions
    in addition to the one dimension in the initial cube of weights.

    The plugin does the following steps:

        1. Creates an initial spatial weights based on the mask in the
           input cube giving zero weight to where there is masked data and
           a weight of 1 where there is valid data.
        2. Make these weights fuzzy by smoothing the boundary between where
           there is valid data and no valid data. This keeps areas of zero
           weight, but reduces nearby grid points with a weight of 1 depending
           on how far they are from a grid point with a weight of zero. The
           range of the effect is controlled by the supplied fuzzy_length
        3. Multiplies the fuzzy spatial weights by the one dimensional weights
           supplied to the plugin.
        4. Normalises the weights along the coordinate that will be collapsed
           when blending is carried out using these weights.
