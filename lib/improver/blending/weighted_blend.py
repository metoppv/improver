    """Class for the percentile blending aggregator

       This class implements the method described by Combining Probabilities
       by Caroline Jones, 2017. This method implements blending in probability
       space.

       The steps are:
           1. At each geographic point in the cube we take the percentile
              threshold's values across the percentile dimensional coordinate.
              We recalculate, using linear interpolation, their probabilities
              in the pdf of the other points across the coordinate we are
              blending over. Thus at each point we have a set of thresholds
              and their corresponding probability values in each of the
              probability spaces across the blending coordinate.
           2. We do a weighted blend across all the probability spaces,
              combining all the thresholds in all the points in the coordinate
              we are blending over. This gives us an array of thresholds and an
              array of blended probabilities for each of the grid points.
           3. We convert back to the original percentile values, again using
              linear interpolation, resulting in blended values at each of the
              original percentiles.
