    The metadata adjustments are:
        - Forecast reference time: If a cycletime is not present, the
          most recent available forecast_reference_time is used.
          If a cycletime is present, the cycletime is used as the
          forecast_reference_time instead.
        - Forecast period: If a forecast_period coordinate is present,
          and cycletime is not present, the lowest forecast_period is
          used. If a forecast_period coordinate is present, and the
          cycletime is present, forecast_periods are forceably calculated
          from the time and forecast_reference_time coordinate. This is
          because, if the cycletime is present, then the
          forecast_reference_time will also have been just re-calculated, so
          the forecast_period coordinate needs to be reset to match the
          newly calculated forecast_reference_time.
        - Forecast reference time and time: If forecast_reference_time and
          time coordinates are present, then a forecast_period coordinate is
          calculated and added to the cube.
        - Model_id, model_realization and realization coordinates are removed.
        - Remove bounds from the scalar coordinates, if the coordinates
          are specified within the coords_for_bounds_removal argument.

            changes to be limited to whichever coordinate is being blended.

    """Class for the percentile blending aggregator

       This class implements the method described by Combining Probabilities
       by Caroline Jones, 2017. This method implements blending in probability
       space.

       The steps are:
           1. At each geographic point in the cube we take the percentile
              threshold's values across the percentile dimensional coordinate.
              We recalculate, using linear interpolation, their probabilities
              in the pdf of the other points across the coordinate we are
              blending over. Thus at each point we have a set of thresholds
              and their corresponding probability values in each of the
              probability spaces across the blending coordinate.
           2. We do a weighted blend across all the probability spaces,
              combining all the thresholds in all the points in the coordinate
              we are blending over. This gives us an array of thresholds and an
              array of blended probailities for each of the grid points.
           3. We convert back to the original percentile values, again using
              linear interpolation, resulting in blended values at each of the
              original percentiles.
