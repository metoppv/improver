        Method to calculate the average value in a square neighbourhood using

        calculate the sum over a neighbourhood of size
        (2*cells_x+1)*(2*cells_y+1). This sum is then divided by the area of
        the neighbourhood to calculate the mean value in the neighbourhood.

        2. Within the function calculate_neighbourhood...
           Four copies of the cumulate array output are flattened and rolled
           by these displacements to align the four terms used in the
           neighbourhood total sum calculation.
