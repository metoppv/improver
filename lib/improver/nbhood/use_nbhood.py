    r"""Class for applying neighbourhood processing when passing in a mask
    cube that is iterated over.

    Example:

        This plugin is designed to work with a set of masks which help you
        select points which are similar and only use these in your
        neighbourhood. The most obvious example of this is to divide the
        points in your cube into bands of similar orographic height.
        ::

            ..............................
            Band 2        ---
            ............./...\.../\.......
            Band 1      /     ---  \
            .........../............\.....
            Band 0    /              --
            ........--.................\..

        In this case the mask cube that comes in has a "topographic_zone"
        coordinate and each slice along this dimension has a 2D mask,
        masking out any points which are outside the topographic band that is
        described by the "topographic_zone" coordinate.

        The result from this plugin is a cube which has applied
        neighbourhooding to the plugin *n* times for the *n* bands in the mask
        cube. Each topography mask has been applied to the input cube in turn,
        resulting in a cube with a "topographic_zone" coordinate which is
        returned from this plugin.

        There is an option to remask the output from the plugin, but if the
        result is left unmasked then the you can weight between adjacent bands
        when you collapse the new "topographic_zone" coordinate. See
        :class:`~improver.nbhood.use_nbhood.\
        CollapseMaskedNeighbourhoodCoordinate`
        for a plugin to collapse the new dimension on the output cube.
        See also :class:`~improver.generate_ancillaries.generate_ancillary.\
        GenerateOrographyBandAncils`

    r"""
    Plugin for collapsing the coordinate the mask was applied to after
    masked neighbourhood processing.

    Takes into account the result from the neighbourhood processing to
    adjust the weights between the bands in the coordinate for the points
    where the were no points within a neighbourhood for and a non-zero
    weighting.

    Example:

        This plugin is designed to work with
        :class:`~improver.nbhood.use_nbhood.\
        ApplyNeighbourhoodProcessingWithAMask` which adds a dimension to the
        resulting cube based on the masks that are applied. This most obvious
        example of these masks are topographic bands which separate the points
        in the field to be neighbourhooded into bands with points of similar
        orographic height.

            ........--.................\..


        The cube that is input into this plugin has had neighbourhooding
        applied *n* times for the *n* bands. We now want to collapse this
        new "topographic_zone" coordinate by weighting between adjacent bands.

        For example below we have two points A and B. Say point A was halfway
        between the midpoint and top of the lower band. We would want to
        generate a final result by weighting 0.75 times to neighbourhooded
        value from the bottom band and 0.25 times the neighbourhooded value in
        the upper band. For point B we would take equal weightings between the
        bands. There is a plugin to generate weights here:
        :class:`~improver.generate_ancillaries.\
        generate_topographic_zone_weights.GenerateTopographicZoneWeights`
        ::

                        A             B
                    ..........................
            band 2

                    ..................x.......
                        x
            band 1
                    ..........................

        We may need adjust the weights if there is missing data in the adjacent
        band. If we look at the diagram with labelled bands, points that are
        near the top of band 2 could be weighted with band 3, except there
        are no nearby points in band 3. In this case the neighbourhood code
        puts NaNs in band 3 and we want to take 100% of band 2. This can be
        easily done by renormalization of the weights.

        Once we have valid weights for adjacent bands for each point we can
        collapse the "topographic_zone" coordinate using a weighted mean.

        When this plugin is used alongside
        :class:`~improver.nbhood.use_nbhood.\
        ApplyNeighbourhoodProcessingWithAMask` we end up with a cube with the
        same dimensions as the original cube, but the neighbourhood processing
        has been applied using masks so that only similar points are used in
        the neighbourhood.
