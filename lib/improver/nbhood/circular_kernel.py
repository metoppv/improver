                2d cube to be padded with a halo.

                Kernel used to specify the neighbourhood to consider when
                calculating the percentiles within a neighbourhood.

        Examples:

            1. Take the input slice_2d cube with the data, where 1 is an
               occurrence and 0 is an non-occurrence::

                    [[1., 1., 1.,],
                     [1., 0., 1.],
                     [1., 1., 1.]]

            2. Define a kernel. This kernel is effectively placed over each
               point within the input data. Note that the input data is padded
               prior to placing the kernel over each point, so that the kernel
               does not exceed the bounds of the padded data::

                    [[ 0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
                     [ 0.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  0.],
                     [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],

                     [ 0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.]]

            3. Pad the input data. The extent of the padding is given by the
               shape of the kernel. The number of values included within the
               calculation of the mean is determined by the size of the
               kernel::

                    [[ 0.75,  0.75,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.75],
                     [ 0.75,  0.75,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.75],
                     [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ],
                     [ 0.5 ,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.  ,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ],
                     [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ],
                     [ 0.75,  0.75,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.75],
                     [ 0.75,  0.75,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.75]]

            4. Calculate the values at the percentiles: [10].
               For the point in the upper right corner within the original
               input data e.g. ::

                    [[->1.<-, 1., 1.,],
                     [  1.,   0., 1.],
                     [  1.,   1., 1.]]

               When the kernel is placed over this point within the padded
               data, then the following points are included::

                    [[   0.75,    0.75,  ->1.<-,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.75],
                     [   0.75,  ->0.75,    1.  ,  0.5<-, 1.  ,  0.75,  0.75],
                     [ ->1.  ,    1.  ,    1.  ,  1.  ,  1.<-,  1.  ,  1.  ],
                     [   0.5 ,  ->0.5 ,    1.  ,  0.<-,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ],
                     [   1.  ,    1.  ,  ->1.<-,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ],
                     [   0.75,    0.75,    1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.75],
                     [   0.75,    0.75,    1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  0.75,  0.75]]

               This gives::

                    [0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]

               As there are 13 points within the kernel, this gives the
               following relationship between percentiles and values.

                  ======  ==========
                  Values  Percentile
                  ======  ==========
                  0.      0
                  0.5     8.33
                  0.5     16.67
                  0.75    25.0
                  1.      33.33
                  1.      41.67
                  1.      50.0
                  1.      58.33
                  1.      66.67
                  1.      75.0
                  1.      83.33
                  1.      91.66
                  1.      100.
                  ======  ==========

               Therefore, for the 10th percentile at the value returned for
               the point in the upper right corner of the original input data
               is 0.5.
               When this process is applied to every point within the original
               input data, the result is::

                    [[[ 0.75,  0.75,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.75,  0.75],
                      [ 0.75,  0.55,  0.55,  0.5 ,  0.55,  0.55,  0.55],
                      [ 0.55,  0.55,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ],
                      [ 0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ],
                      [ 0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.55,  0.55],
                      [ 0.55,  0.55,  0.55,  0.5 ,  0.55,  0.55,  0.75],

            5. The padding is then removed to give::

                   [[[ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5],
                     [ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5],
