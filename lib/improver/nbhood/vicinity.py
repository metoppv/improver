        Initialise the class.

        Args:
            distance (float):
                Distance in metres used to define the vicinity within which to
                search for an occurrence.
            neighbourhood_method (str):
                Name of the neighbourhood method to use. Options: 'circular',
                'square'.
            radii (float or List if defining lead times):
                The radii in metres of the neighbourhood to apply.
                Rounded up to convert into integer number of grid
                points east and north, based on the characteristic spacing
                at the zero indices of the cube projection-x and y coords.

        Keyword Args:
            lead_times (None or List):
                List of lead times or forecast periods, at which the radii
                within 'radii' are defined. The lead times are expected
                in hours.
            ens_factor (float):
                The factor with which to adjust the neighbourhood size
                for more than one ensemble member.
                If ens_factor = 1.0 this essentially conserves ensemble
                members if every grid square is considered to be the
                equivalent of an ensemble member.
                Optional, defaults to 1.0
            weighted_mode (boolean):
                If True, use a circle for neighbourhood kernel with
                weighting decreasing with radius.
                If False, use a circle with constant weighting.
