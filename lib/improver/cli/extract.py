    Extracts subset of data from a single cube, subject to equality-based
    constraints.
    Using a set of constraints, extract a sub-cube from the provided cube if it
    is available.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            The Cube from which a sub-cube is extracted
        constraints (list):
            The constraint(s) to be applied.  These must be of the form
            "key=value", eg "threshold=1".  Scalars, boolean and string
            values are supported.  Comma-separated lists
            e.g. key=[value1,value2,value3]
            are supported.
            These comma-separated lists can either extract all values
            specified in the list or all values specified within a range
            e.g. key=[value1:value3].
            When a range is specified, this is inclusive of the endpoints of
            the range.
        units (list):
            List of units as strings corresponding to each coordinate in the
            list of constraints. One or more "units" may be None and units may
            only be associated with coordinate constraints.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            A single cube matching the input constraints or None. If no
            sub-cube is found within the cube that matches the constraints.
