    """Module to apply a recursive filter to neighbourhooded data.

    Run a recursive filter to convert a square neighbourhood into a
    Gaussian-like kernel or smooth over short distances. The filter uses an
    alpha parameter (0 alpha < 1) to control what proportion of the
    probability is passed onto the next grid-square in the x and y directions.
    The alpha parameter can be set on a grid square by grid-square basis for
    the x and y directions separately (using two arrays of alpha parameters
    of the same dimensionality as the domain).
    Alternatively a single alpha value can be set for each of the x and y
    direction and a float for the y direction and vice versa.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube to be processed.
        mask_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube to mask the processed cube.
            Default is None.
        alphas_x_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube describing the alpha factors to be used for smoothing in the
            x direction.
            Default is None.
        alphas_y_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube describing the alpha factors to be used for smoothing in the
            y direction.
            Default is None.
        alpha_x (float):
            A single alpha factor (0 < alpha_x < 1) to be applied to every
            grid square in the x direction.
            Default is None.
        alpha_y (float):
            A single alpha factor (0 < alpha_y < 1) to be applied to every grid
            square in the y direction.
            Default is None.
        iterations (int):
            Number of times to apply the filter. (Typically < 3)
            Number of iterations should be 2 or less, higher values have been
            shown to lead to poorer conservation.
            Default is 1 (one).
        re_mask (bool):
            Re-apply mask to recursively filtered output.
            Default is False.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            The processed Cube.
