    """Module to calculate continuous snow falling level.

    Calculate the wet-bulb temperature integral by firstly calculating the
    wet-bulb temperature from the inputs provided and then calculating the
    vertical integral of the wet-bulb temperature.
    Find the falling_snow_level by finding the height above sea level
    corresponding to the falling_level_threshold in the integral data.

    Args:
        temperature (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of air temperature at heights (m) at the points for which the
            continuous falling snow level is being calculated.
        relative_humidity (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of relative humidities at heights (m) at the points for which
            the continuous falling snow level is being calculated.
        pressure (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of air pressure at heights (m) at the points for which the
            continuous falling snow level is being calculated.
        orog (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of the orography height in m of the terrain over which the
            continuous falling snow level is being calculated.
        land_sea (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing the binary land-sea mask for the points for which
            the continuous falling snow level is being calculated. Land points
            are set to 1, sea points are set to 0.
        precision (float):
            Precision to which the wet-bulb temperature is required: This is
            used by the Newton iteration.
            Default is 0.005.
        falling_level_threshold (float):
            Cutoff threshold for the wet-bulb integral used to calculate the
            falling snow level. This threshold indicates the level at which
            falling snow is deemed to have melted to become rain.
            Default is 90.0.

        iris.cube.Cube:
            Processed Cube of falling snow level above sea level.
