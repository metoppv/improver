    Args:
        input_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            The input Cube to be processed.
        advection_cubes (iris.cube.CubeList):
            Advection cubes of U and V.
        oe_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing the orographic enhancement fields. May have data
            for multiple times in the cube.
            Default is None.
        attributes_dict (dict):
            Dictionary containing the required changes to the attributes.
            Default is None.
        max_lead_time (int):
            Maximum lead time required (mins).
            Default is 360.
        lead_time_interval (int):
            Interval between required lead times (mins).
            Default is 15.
        accumulation_period (int):
            The period over which the accumulation is calculated (mins).
            Only full accumulation periods will be computed. At lead times
            that are shorter than the accumulation period, no accumulation
            output will be produced.
        accumulation_units (str):
            Desired units in which the accumulations should be expressed.
            e.g. 'mm'
            Default is 'm'.
