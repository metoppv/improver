    Determine grid point coordinates within the provided cubes that neighbour
    spot data sites defined within the provided JSON/Dictionary.

    found for each site. Other constrained neighbour finding methods can be

    1. Nearest neighbour.

    3. Nearest neighbour with minimum height difference.
    4. Nearest land point neighbour with minimum height difference.

    Args:
        orography (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of model orography for the model grid on which neighbours are
            being found.
        landmask (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of model land mask for the model grid on which neighbours are
            being found.
        site_list (dict):
            Dictionary that contains the spot sites for which neighbouring grid
            points are to be found.
        all_methods (bool):
            If True, this will return a cube containing the nearest grid point
            neighbours to spot sites as defined by each possible combination
            of constraints.
            Default is False.
        land_constraint (bool):
            If True, this will return a cube containing the nearest grid point
            neighbours to spot sites that are also land points. May be used
            with the minimum_dz option.
            Default is None.
        minimum_dz (bool):
            If True, this will return a cube containing the nearest grid point
            neighbour to each spot site that is found, within a given search
            radius, to minimise the height difference between the two. May be
            used with the land_constraint option.
            Default is None.
        search_radius (float):
            The radius in metres about a spot site within which to search for
            a grid point neighbour that is land or which has a smaller height
            difference than the nearest.
            Default is None.
        node_limit (int):
            When searching within the defined search_radius for suitable
            neighbours, a KDTree is constructed. This node_limit prevents the
            tree from becoming too large for large search radii. A default of
            36 will be set, which is to say the nearest 36 grid points will be
            considered. If the search radius is likely to contain more than
            36 points, this value should be increased to ensure all point
            are considered.
            Default is None.
        site_coordinate_system (cartopy coordinate system):
            The coordinate system in which the site coordinates are provided
            within the site list. This must be provided as the name of a
            cartopy coordinate system. The Default will become PlateCarree.
            Default is None.
        site_coordinate_options (str):
            JSON formatted string of options passed to the cartopy coordinate
            system given in site_coordinate_system. "globe" is handled as a
            special case to construct a cartopy Globe object.
            Default is None.
        site_x_coordinate (str):
            The key that identifies site x coordinates in the provided site
            dictionary. Defaults to longitude.
            Default is None.
        site_y_coordinate (str):
            The key that identifies site y coordinates in the provided site
            dictionary. Defaults to latitude.
            Default is None.
