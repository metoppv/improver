def main(argv=None):
    r"""
    Load arguments and run ProbabilitiesFromPercentiles plugin.

    Plugin generates probabilities at a fixed threshold (height) from a set of
    (height) percentiles.

    Example:

        Snow-fall level::

            Reference field: Percentiled snow fall level (m ASL)
            Other field: Orography (m ASL)

            300m ----------------- 30th Percentile snow fall level
            200m ----_------------ 20th Percentile snow fall level
            100m ---/-\----------- 10th Percentile snow fall level
            000m --/---\----------  0th Percentile snow fall level
            ______/     \_________ Orogaphy

        The orography heights are compared against the heights that correspond
        with percentile values to find the band in which they fall, then
        interpolated linearly to obtain a probability of snow level at / below
        the ground surface.
