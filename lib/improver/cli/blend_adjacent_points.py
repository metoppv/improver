    Uses the TriangularWeightedBlendAcrossAdjacentPoints to blend across

    Args:

        coordinate (str):
            The coordinate over which the blending will be applied.
        central_point (float):
            Central point at which the output from the triangular weighted
            blending will be calculated. This should be in the units of the
            units argument that is passed in. This value should be a point
            on the coordinate for blending over.
        units (str):
            Units of the central_point and width
        width (float):
