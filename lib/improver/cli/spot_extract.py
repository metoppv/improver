    """Module to run spot data extraction.

    Extract diagnostic data from gridded fields for spot data sites. It is
    possible to apply a temperature lapse rate adjustment to temperature data
    that helps to account for differences between the spot site's real altitude
    and that of the grid point from which the temperature data is extracted.

    Args:
        neighbour_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of spot-data neighbours and the spot site information.
        diagnostic_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing the diagnostic data to be extracted.
        lapse_rate_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube containing temperature lapse rates. If this cube is provided
            and a screen temperature cube is being processed, the lapse rates
            will be used to adjust the temperature to better represent each
            spot's site-altitude.
        apply_lapse_rate_correction (bool):
            If True, and a lapse rate cube has been provided, extracted
            screen temperature will be adjusted to better match the altitude
            of the spot site for which they have been extracted.
            Default is False.
        land_constraint (bool):
            If True, the neighbour cube will be interrogated for grid point
            neighbours that were identified using a land constraint. This means
            that the grid points should be land points except for sites where
            none were found within the search radius when the neighbour cube
            was created. May be used with minimum_dz.
            Default is False.
        minimum_dz (bool):
            If True, the neighbour cube will be interrogated for grid point
            neighbours that were identified using the minimum height
            difference constraint. These are grid points that were found to be
            the closest in altitude to the spot site within the search radius
            defined when the neighbour cube was created. May be used with
            land_constraint.
            Default is False.
        extract_percentiles (list or int):
            If set to a percentile value or a list of percentile values,
            data corresponding to those percentiles will be returned. For
            example [25, 50, 75] will result in the 25th, 50th and 75th
            percentiles being returned from a cube of probabilities,
            percentiles or realizations.
            Note that for percentiles inputs, the desired percentile(s) must
            exist in the input cube.
            Default is None.
        ecc_bounds_warning (bool):
            If True, where calculated percentiles are outside the ECC bounds
            range, raises a warning rather than an exception.
            Default is False.
        attributes_dict (dict):
            If provided, this dictionary can be used to modify the attributes
            of the returned cube.
            Default is None.
        suppress_warnings (bool):
            Suppress warning output. This option should only be used if it
            is known that warnings will be generated but they are not required.
            Default is None.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
           The processed cube.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If the percentile diagnostic cube does not contain the requested
            percentile value.
        ValueError:
            If the lapse rate cube was provided but the diagnostic being

           If diagnostic cube is not a known probabilistic type.
        warning:
            If a lapse rate cube was provided, but the height of the
            temperature does not match that of the data used.
        warning:
            If a lapse rate cube was not provided, but the option to apply
