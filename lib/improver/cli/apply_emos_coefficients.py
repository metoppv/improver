    Load in arguments for applying coefficients for Ensemble Model Output
    Statistics (EMOS), otherwise known as Non-homogeneous Gaussian
    Regression (NGR). The coefficients are applied to the forecast
    that is supplied, so as to calibrate the forecast. The calibrated
    forecast is written to a cube. If no coefficients are provided the input
    forecast is returned unchanged.

    Args:
        current_forecast (iris.cube.Cube):
            A Cube containing the forecast to be calibrated. The input format
            could be either realizations, probabilities or percentiles.
        coeffs (iris.cube.Cube or None):
            A cube containing the coefficients used for calibration or None.
            If none then then current_forecast is returned unchanged.
        landsea_mask (iris.cube.Cube or None):
            A cube containing the land-sea mask on the same domain as the

        num_realizations (numpy.int32):
            Optional argument to specify the number of ensemble realizations
            to produce. If the current forecast is input as probabilities or
            percentiles then this argument is used to create the requested
            number of realizations. In addition, this argument is used to
            construct the requested number of realizations from the mean and
            variance output after applying the EMOS coefficients.
            Default is None.
        random_ordering (bool):
            Option to reorder the post-processed forecasts randomly. If not
            set, the ordering of the raw ensemble is used. This option is
            only valid when the input format is realizations.
            Default is False.
        random_seed (int):
            Option to specify a value for the random seed for testing
            purposes, otherwise the default random seen behaviour is utilised.
            The random seed is used in the generation of the random numbers
            used for either the random_ordering option to order the input
            percentiles randomly, rather than use the ordering from the raw
            ensemble, or for splitting tied values within the raw ensemble,

            match the raw ensemble.
            Default is None.
        ecc_bounds_warning (bool):
            If True, where the percentiles exceed the ECC bounds range,
            raises a warning rather than an exception. This occurs when the
            current forecasts is in the form of probabilities and is
            converted to percentiles, as part of converting the input
            probabilities into realizations.
            Default is False.
        predictor_of_mean (str):
            String to specify the predictor used to calibrate the forecast
            mean. Currently the ensemble mean "mean" as the ensemble
            realization "realization" are supported as options.
