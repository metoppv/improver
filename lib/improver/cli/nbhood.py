    """Runs neighbourhood processing.

    Apply the requested neighbourhood method via the
    NeighbourhoodProcessing plugin to a Cube.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            The Cube to be processed.
        neighbourhood_output (str):
            The form of the results generated using neighbourhood processing.
            If "probabilities" is selected, the mean probability with a
            neighbourhood is calculated. If "percentiles" is selected, then
            the percentiles are calculated with a neighbourhood. Calculating
            percentiles from a neighbourhood is only supported for a circular
            neighbourhood.
            Options: "probabilities", "percentiles".
        neighbourhood_shape (str):
            Name of the neighbourhood method to use. Only a "circular"
            neighbourhood shape is applicable for calculating "percentiles"
            output.
            Options: "circular", "square".
        radius (float):
            The radius in metres of the neighbourhood to apply
        radii_by_lead_time (list):
            A list with the radius in metres at [0] and the lead_time at [1]
            Lead time is a List of lead times or forecast periods, at which
            the radii within 'radii' are defined. The lead times are expected
            in hours.
        degrees_as_complex (bool):
            If True processes angles as complex numbers.
            Not compatible with circular kernel, percentiles or recursive
            filter.
            Default is False.
        weighted_mode (bool):
            If True the weighting decreases with radius.
            If False a constant weighting is assumed.
            weighted_mode is only applicable for calculating "probability"
            neighbourhood output using the circular kernal.
            Default is False
        sum_or_fraction (str):
            Identifier for whether sum or fraction should be returned from
            neighbourhooding. The sum represents the sum of the neighbourhood.
            The fraction represents the sum of the neighbourhood divided by
            the neighbourhood area.
            Default is "fraction".
        re_mask (bool):
            If re_mask is True, the original un-neighbourhood processed mask
            is applied to mask out the neighbourhood processed cube.
            If re_mask is False, the original un-neighbourhood processed mask
            is not applied. Therefore, the neighbourhood processing may result
            in values being present in area that were originally masked.
            Default is False.
        percentiles (float or None):
            Calculates value at the specified percentiles from the
            neighbourhood surrounding each grid point.
            Default is improver.constants.DEFAULT_PERCENTILES.
        mask_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube to mask the input cube. The data should contain 1 for
            usable points and 0 for discarded points.
            Only supported with square neighbourhoods.
            Default is None.
        halo_radius (float or None):
            Radius in metres of excess halo to clip. Used where a larger grid
            was defined than the standard grid and we want to clip the grid
            back to the standard grid.
            Default is None.
        apply_recursive_filter (bool):
            Boolean to apply the recursive filter to a square neighbourhooded
            output dataset, converting it into a Gaussian-like kernel or
            smoothing over short distances.
            Default is False.
        alphas_x_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A Cube used for the smoothing in the x direction when applying
            the recursive filter.
            Default is None.
        alphas_y_cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            A Cube used for the smoothing in the y direction when applying
            the recursive filter.
            Default is None.
        alpha_x (float):
            A single alpha factor (0 < alpha_x < 1) to be applied to every grid
            square in the x direction when applying the recursive filter.
            Default is None.
        alpha_y (float):
            A single alpha factor (0 < alpha_x < 1) to be applied to every grid
            square in the y direction when applying the recursive filter.
