    """Module for estimate coefficients for Ensemble Model Output Statistics.

    Loads in arguments for estimating coefficients for Ensemble Model
    Output Statistics (EMOS), otherwise known as Non-homogeneous Gaussian
    Regression (NGR). Two sources of input data must be provided: historical
    forecasts and historical truth data (to use in calibration).
    The estimated coefficients are output as a cube.

    Args:
        historic_forecast (iris.cube.Cube):
            The cube containing the historical forecasts used for calibration.
        truth (iris.cube.Cube):
            The cube containing the truth used for calibration.
        combined (iris.cube.CubeList):
            A cubelist containing a combination of historic forecasts and
            associated truths.
        historic_forecast_dict (dict):
            Dictionary specifying the metadata that defines the historic
            forecast. For example:
            ::

                {
                    "attributes": {
                        "mosg__model_configuration": "uk_ens"
                    }
                }
        truth_dict (dict):
            Dictionary specifying the metadata that defines the truth.
            For example:
            ::

                {
                    "attributes": {
                        "mosg__model_configuration": "uk_det"
                    }
                }
        distribution (str):
            The distribution that will be used for calibration. This will be
            dependant upon the input phenomenon.
        cycletime (str):
            This denotes the cycle at which forecasts will be calibrated using
            the calculated EMOS coefficients. The validity time in the output
            coefficients cube will be calculated relative to this cycletime.
            This cycletime is in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ.
        landsea_mask (iris.cube.Cube):
            A cube containing the land-sea mask on the same domain as the
            historic forecasts and truth. Land points are set to one and sea
            points are set to one.
        units (str):
            The units that calibration should be undertaken in. The historical
            forecast and truth will be converted as required.
            Default is None.
        predictor_of_mean (str):
            String to specify the input to calculate the calibrated mean.
            Currently the ensemble mean ("mean") and the ensemble realizations
            ("realizations") are supported as the predictors.
            Default is 'mean'.
        max_iterations (int):
            The maximum number of iterations allowed until the minimisation has
            converged to a stable solution. If the maximum number of iterations
            is reached but the minimisation has not yet converged to a stable
            solution, then the available solution is used anyway, and a warning
            is raised.
            If the predictor_of_mean is "realizations", then the number of
            iterations may require increasing, as there will be more
            coefficients to solve.
            Default is 1000.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube or None:
            Cube containing the coefficients estimated using EMOS. The cube
            contains a coefficient_index dimension coordinate and a
            coefficient_name auxiliary coordinate. If no historic forecasts or
            truths are found then None is returned.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the historic forecast and truth inputs are specified,
            then the combined input, historic forecast dictionary and truth
            dictionary should not be specified.
