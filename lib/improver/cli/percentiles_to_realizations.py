    """Runs Ensemble Copula Coupling processing.

    Converts a dataset containing percentiles into one containing ensemble
    realizations using Ensemble Coupla Coupling.

    Args:
        cube (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube expected to contain a percentiles coordinate.
        raw_forecast (iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube of raw (not post processed) weather data.
            This option is compulsory, if the reordering option is selected.
        no_of_percentiles (int):
            The number of percentiles to be generated. This is also equal to
            the number of ensemble realizations that will be generated.
            Default is None.
        sampling_method (str):
            Method to be used for generating the list of percentiles with
            forecasts generated at each percentile. The options are "quantile"
            and "random".
            The quantile option produces equally spaced percentiles which is
            the preferred option for full ensemble couple coupling with
            reordering enabled.
            Default is 'quantile'.
        ecc_bounds_warning (bool):
            If True where percentiles (calculated as an intermediate output
            before realization) exceed the ECC bounds range, raises a
            warning rather than an exception.
            Default is False.
        reordering (bool):
            The option used to create ensemble realizations from percentiles
            by reordering the input percentiles based on the order of the
            raw ensemble forecast.
            Default is False.
        rebadging (bool):
            The option used to create ensemble realizations from percentiles
            by rebadging the input percentiles.
            Default is False.
        random_ordering (bool):
            If random_ordering is True, the post-processed forecasts are
            reordered randomly, rather than using the ordering of the
            raw ensemble.
            Default is False.
        random_seed (int):
            Option to specify a value for the random seed for testing purposes,
            otherwise, the default random seed behaviour is utilised.
            The random seed is used in the generation of the random numbers
            used for either the random_ordering option to order the input
            percentiles randomly, rather than use the ordering from the
            raw ensemble, or for splitting tied values within the raw ensemble
            so that the values from the input percentiles can be ordered to
            match the raw ensemble.
            Default is None.
        realization_numbers (list of ints):
            A list of ensemble realization numbers to use when rebadging the
            percentiles into realizations.
            Default is None.

    Returns:
        iris.cube.Cube:
            The processed Cube.
