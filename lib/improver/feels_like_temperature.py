    Calculates the wind chill from 10 m wind speed and temperature based on
    the wind chill temperature index from a linear regression equation detailed
    in THE NEW WIND CHILL EQUIVALENT TEMPERATURE CHART, Osczevski and
    Bluestein, 2005, table 2.

    Args:
      temperature (iris.cube.Cube):
        Cube of air temperatures

      wind_speed (iris.cube.Cube):
        Cube of 10m wind speeds

    Returns:
      iris.cube.Cube:
        Cube of wind chill temperatures. The units of wind chill will be the
        same as the units of the temperature cube when it is input into the
        function.

    Science background:
    The 2005 Osczevski and Bluestein paper outlines the research and the
    assumptions made, and the 2008 paper clarifies poorly explained sections
    of the first paper.

    A brief summary of their assumptions are given below:
    The model aims to determine a worst-case scenario of wind chill. The wind
    speed "threshold" of 4.8 kph (1.34 m/s) stated in the 2005 papers does not
    refer to a threshold placed on the input windspeed data, which has no upper
    limit, but is the walking speed of an average person. This is therefore
    used as the minimum wind speed in their wind chill computer model, because
    even where wind speed is zero, a person would still experience wind chill
    from the act of walking (the model assumes that the person is walking into
    the wind). The model introduces a compensation factor where it assumes that
    the wind speed at 1.5 m (face level) is 2/3 that measured at 10 m. It also
    takes into account the thermal resistance of the skin on the human cheek
    with the assumption that the face is the most exposed area of skin
    during winter.

    The equation outlined in their paper is also not the equation used in their
    model (which was computationally expensive) but rather it is a linear
    regression equation which mimics the output of their model where wind
    speeds are greater than 3kph (0.8m/s) (clarified in the 2008 paper). The
    assumption being that lower wind speeds are usually not measured or
    reported accurately anyway.

    Calculates the apparent temperature from 10 m wind speed, temperature
    and actual vapour pressure using the linear regression equation
    for shade described in A Universal Scale of Apparent Temperature,
    Steadman, 1984, page 1686, table 5.

    The method used to determine the original values used for the regression
    equation takes into account many variables which are detailed in Steadman's
    paper.

    The paper calculates apparent temperature for wind speeds up to 20 m/s.
    Here, the apparent temperature regression equation has been used for all
    wind speeds.

    This function looks up a value for the saturation vapour pressure of
    water vapour using the temperature and a table of values. These tabulated
    values are found using lookup_svp and are corrected to the saturated
    vapour pressure in air using pressure_correct_svp, both functions are from
    the WetBulbTemperature plugin which makes use of the Goff-Gratch method.
