    Function to convert data from a N-dimensional cube into a 2d
    numpy array. The result can be transposed, if required.

        forecast (iris.cube.Cube):
            N-dimensional cube to be reshaped.
        coord (string):
            The data will be flattened along this coordinate.
        transpose (boolean):
            If True, the resulting flattened data is transposed.
            This will transpose a 2d array of the format [:, coord]
