    Plugin to calculate the lapse rate from orography and temperature

    References:
        The method applied here is based on the method used in the 2010 paper:
        https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/met.177

    Code methodology:

    1) Apply land/sea mask to temperature and orography datasets. Mask sea
       points as NaN since image processing module does not recognise Numpy
       masks.
    2) Extracts neighbourhoods from both datasets:
       Apply "generic_filter" image processing module to temperature data
       to extract a neighbourhood for each single point and save this
       neighbourhood into a larger array.
       Repeat for orography data.
       generic_filter mode="constant" ensures that points beyond edges of
       dataset will be filled with "cval". (NaN in this case)
    3) For all the stored orography neighbourhoods - take the neighbours around
       the central point and create a mask where the height difference from
       the central point is greater than 35m.
    4) Loop through array of neighbourhoods and take the height and temperature
       of all grid points and calculate the
       temperature/height gradient = lapse rate
    5) Constrain the lapse rate as > DALR and < -3.0*DALR.
