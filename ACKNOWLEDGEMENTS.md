  - .travis.yml, derived from Iris travis setup
  - .gitignore used as basis for ours
  - environment.yml derived from Iris minimal conda environment

Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org), BSD:
  - doc/Makefile, doc/source/conf.py and doc/source/index.rst derived
    from defaults generated by `sphinx-quickstart`.
  - Generation of API documentation during build uses
    `sphinx-apidoc` and is based on solution posted by BowenFu:
