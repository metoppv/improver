Column,Dtype,Notes
forecast,float64,The value for a particular forecast.
altitude,float32,The altitude in metres.
blend_time,"datetime64[ns,UTC]",The time at which a blend of models was produced.
forecast_period,timedelta64[ns],The difference between the blend time (and forecast reference time) and the validity time.
forecast_reference_time,"datetime64[ns,UTC]",The time at which the forecast analysis was made for a forecast from a single source. Equal to the blend_time for a forecast created from blending multiple forecast sources.
latitude,float32,The latitude in degrees.

percentile,float64,The percentile value.
period,timedelta64[ns],The period the forecast valid is over. Set to missing data for instantaneous forecasts.
