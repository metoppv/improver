Approach
--------
The easiest way to explain the IMPROVER metadata from a user perspective
is to dive straight in and look at an actual example of the metadata for a real file.
For this purpose, we will consider 
gridded probabilities for a 1-hour maximum temperature exceeding a range of thresholds
from a Met Office forecast on an extended UK domain generated by using Met Office 
model data. We will look at two common views of the metadata:

 - How the ncdump utility would display the netCDF file metadata 
 - How iris would display the cube
