Making a new release

2. On the `Code page for improver <https://github.com/metoppv/improver/>` 
   click on the Tags button (with a tag icon and a number of existing Tags)
   to see existing tags.
3. Click on the Releases button (next to Tags) to see existing releases.
4. Click on the Draft a new release button.
5. On the Draft a new release page, click the Select tag dropdown menu,
   and create a new tag by typing in the new version number (e.g., ``1.18.8``).
6. Add a description to the release to describe changes that have been made 
   since the last release, then click the Publish release button.
7. At some point after publishing the release, github will create a compressed
   ``.tar.gz`` file of the source code for that release.
